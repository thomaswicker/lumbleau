"YOU ARE AN INCREDIBLE TEACHER"
Dear Mr Lumbleau, I just took the Broker exam in Oakland, CA and PASSED the first time! I thought your course was very good at an unbelievable price! Many of the identical questions on your practice exams were on the test. Most importantly, I learned so much from your online lectures. You are an incredible teacher, explaining difficult concepts in a very interesting way. Thank you very much! Karen Paulsen

"I PASSED THE BROKER EXAM"
Lumbleau Real Estate Schools is the oldest Real Estate School in California and today I send a great big THANK YOU to John Lumbleau! The reason for my thank you is today I received notice that I passed the California Department of Real Estate BROKER's EXAM! And I am thanking John, for preparing me to take and pass the exam. The Lumbleau Real Estate Schools. The prep program was both thorough and demanding. But, as I was seated and waiting for the exam...a sense of calm came over me. As the exam progressed, I could hear the distinctive voice of John Lumbleau. You see...John knows more about the Department of Real Estate exams than just about anybody in California. There were no surprises on the exam and I felt well prepared...nervous, but well prepared! Thank You...JOHN LUMBLEAU! You're the man...

"I DON'T THINK I WOULD HAVE MADE IT OTHERWISE"
John, Last Friday I took the CA. Broker's Exam for the first time and PASSED ! I want to thank you for the excellent teaching techniques you provide with your materials. I don't think I would have made it otherwise. Sincerely 
Marcia Pawlowski

"THE FIRST REPORT ON THE NEW SCRAMBLED QUESTION COMPUTER EXAMS"
Hi Mr. Lumbleau, Thanks for all the guided help for the preparation of the California Broker's Exam. Taking the exam in the new computerized testing center, the results were given immediately after the completion of the test, which I passed on 09/09/2009! Your advice on working through the chapters one by one cannot be overemphasized to get the successful result of passing the broker's exam. The organization of your prep course was very helpful and the questions to focus on were very exact. All I had to do was to consistently work through each chapter and gauge the weeks leading up to the actual exam date. The basic structure of your course offered the main concepts by repetition. That is why I could remember a great percentage of the material. Your material was relevant in content for a good prep. Since I had worked through your guided material, I was able to capture and remember a great part of the question/answer sets throughout the real exam. Thank you once again. Now, I am ready to start my own LLC as a realty business. I'm listening to the "Success Video" included in your Web site.Sincerely, 
Emma Kwong


"I WAS ACTUALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO TAKING THE EXAM"
Dear Mr. Lumbleau: I have known for years of your fine reputation, so when I applied for my California Real Estate Broker's license, I immediately enrolled in your program. I just found out I passed, and on my first attempt. Your course was so complete, so thorough, I was actually looking forward to taking the examination. And the instructions of how to approach the questions, made it even easier. Thank you. A grateful student, TJ Smith,
TJ Smith,


"YOUR LECTURES WERE LIVELY, INFORMATIVE AND INSPIRATIONAL"
Dear Mr. Lumbleau: I just wanted to drop you a note to say thank you after successfully concluding your wonderful DVD-based course. Your lectures were lively, informative, and highly inspirational. (Your two guest lecturers were okay, too.) Keep up the good work! Norman Lee

"HOW WONDERFUL THE EXAM EXPERIENCE WAS AFTER TAING YOUR COURSE"
Hello John, I just wanted to let you know how wonderful the exam experience was after taking your course. I passed the broker exam on 4/22/09 with absolutely no difficulty beyond answering every one of your course questions and taking the four practice tests. The exam in comparison to the practice questions seemed so easy. Many of the questions I recognized and some almost word for word. I was confident and comfortable in the exam room and was the first one out of the room. As I walked by my fellow examinees on the way out, I noticed that several were still working on questions below number 70. Unbelievable! When I was shopping schools I called your 877 number on a Sunday and you personally answered the phone. "Who else could you get to work on a Sunday?" you asked and then you took another 15 minutes to discuss the process and why your school was the best. Well John, it was the best and I want to sincerely thank you for your dedication and commitment to your students and the RE industry. Thank you again for everything,
Scott Hofer


"IT WAS A BREEZE IN THE EXAM ROOM"
Hi John, I think I raised my score 9%+ with your final 3 self-exams and exam updates.I just received a "pass" on my broker exam, first try. If I had to guess, I think I scored between 96 and 98% with an outside chance of nailing all 200 questions for 100%. It was a breeze in the exam room. Thanks again for the 3000+ prep questions.

"YOUR REAL ESTATE SCHOOL IS TRULY THE BEST"
Dear John--I am writing to inform I've pass my Broker state exam on Feb. 2, 2009 in Oakland, Calif. I bought your study course back in August 2008 after failing twice! I want to thank you for making your course so easy and wonderful. I retained more information than any other course I tried. I paid $199, spent 8 hours, and 2 days crash course with another company to no avail. I tried your course, it was easy to learn. The questions I did not understand and missed, I marked it, I came back to study the question and within months I was confidence in answering any question. I took my exam last monday and finished it with 40 minutes time to spree. It felt good! Your real estate school is truly the best. I will recommend it to anyone preparing for their state Broker exam. Feel free to give out my information for references. Thank you,
Kao Saechao


"WHEN I TOOK THE EXAM I KNEW I HAD PASSED"
Thank you for your excellent program. Your system works. I completed the program as instructed and when I took the exam I knew I had passed. I have been referring your program to anyone that asks me what I used to study for the broker exam. In fact, while I was at the exam I was asked what program I used and I told them I found the secret, Lumbleau, and told them if they did not pass to go to your website immediately and sign up! Thank you, again, for offering this GREAT program. Respectfully,
Christina Lister


"THERE IS NO COMPARISON"
Dear John ,I spoke with you one month ago I had taken the class from xxxxxx and missed the Brokers by a few points. I then took your class study program and just passed. Thanks so much. Your material is comprehensive, succinct, and easy to follow. There is no comparison to xxxxxx.Thanks again .

"I PASSED THE EXAM WITHOUT ANY PROBLEMS AFTER FAILING TWICE AT ANOTHER SCHOOL"
Hello Mr. Lumbleau; I enrolled in the California State Broker Exam course with your school. I was a 62 years young at the time and I passed the exam without any problems after failing twice with another school. I find being a follower of you and Dr. Napoleon Hill a wise decision. I vision the future to be full steam ahead by passing this exam! I certainly thank you very much for the opportunity to take this course. A friend called wanting information concerrning the Broker Exam. I proudly gave your information.

"GREAT SYSTEM YOU HAVE"
Hi John! Great news, just passed my broker's exam and for all your future students, the key is STUDYING your lesson plans very carefully and to understand the material inside and out, it will definitely make passing the exam a lot easier! Our DRE examiner told us that the department just re-wrote the exam booklets so there are brand new questions, another reason to study your material very carefully. Great system you have Mr. Lumbleau! My future opportunities have really opened up for me and thanks to you and your team, you guys are available 7 days a week it seems! Kindest regards, 
Ling Tseng


"THE OTHER PEOPLE TAKING THE TEST WERE ALL ASTONISHED"
Dear Mr. Lumbleau, Your course is great. I passed the Broker's exam on my first attempt, having no previous Real Estate experience. I knew the material so soundly that I finished each section in just over an hour. The other people taking the test were all astonished, especially when they heard it was my first attempt, since many of them were on their 2nd or 3rd try. Thank you, 
Mira Raman


"WORKED LIKE A CHARM"

"YOUR PROGRAM MADE THE BROKERS EXAM A "BREEZE""
Dear Mr. Lumbleau:I would like to start off by saying “THANK YOU,” for helping me pass the Brokers Exam on the first attempt. Your well organized material was presented in such a way that one could not help but pass. After finishing with the “Exam Update B 198,” the night before, I walked out of the exam room, the next day, knowing that I had achieved a score of at least 90%. Your program made the Brokers Exam a BREEZE!!! Thank you again for all of your wonderful work. Many Blessings,
Luis Frausto


"OUTSTANDING PROGRAM"

"I PASSED THE FIRST TIME USING YOUR MATERIALS"
I purchased your course in February of 2008, and I finally passed my broker exam! Thank you! I was using study materials from XXXXXX, and had three unsuccessful attempts. I passed the first time using your material. During the break at the exam, I told everyone about Lumbleau.

"LUMBLEAU YOU ROCK"
Lumbleau you rock!! Thanks for giving me the tools and training needed to pass the broker exam. I couldn’t have done it without you. I am looking forward to checking out your other success videos as well.

"YOUR PROGRAM MADE IT EFFORTLESS TO PAS THE EXAM"
Let me 1st thank you for the positive learning experience I had with your Broker Approval program. It was an immense help in getting my Brokers license. It was very educational and rewarding. Your program made it effortless to pass the exam. Dave Simas

"THE BROKER'S STYUDY GUIDE IS AMAZING"
I had taken all the necessary courses to become a Broker over the past 2 years so I was anxious to complete my Broker's Exam. I had obtained study materials from another company & studied it for a whole month to pass the exam. Of course, I was dissapointed when I did not pass because I had studied so hard. After I obtained my results of my weak points, another Broker recommended Lumbleau. I had temporarily forgotten about the exam but then decided to go ahead & purchase the course. There were a lot of questions but I focused on what I had missed the first time around. On 4/9/08, I passed my exam & just before getting married. The Broker's Study Guide is amazing & I highly recommend it. Good luck.
Shirleen Pratap


"I WISH I WOULD HAVE FOUND YOUR CLASS FIRST"
I just wanted to thank you for guiding me through the Brokers TEST!!! Your class was the easiest to obsorb and retain. I knew when I took it that I had passed! I wish I would have found your class first....I would have saved ALOT OF TIME AND $$$$$$$$!! Thanks!
Alyce Dupont


"I'VE TRIED TO PASS THAT EXAM FOR YEARS UNTIL I FOUND OUT ABOUT YOUR SCHOOL"
John, Thanks so very much for your program that helped me pass that Broker's Exam. I felt I had been in battle which ended in a major victory for me. I've tried to pass that test for years until I found out about your school. Man, what a victory!!! Regards,
John (J.W.) Smith


"I APPRECIATE YOUR AVAILABILITY, HONESTY AND NO-NONSENCE APPROACH"
Hi John, I wanted to let you know that I just received confirmation that I passed my Broker's examination! I took the test on March 6th, 2008. I appreciate your availability, honesty and no-nonsense approach. I did everything that was requested (of me) on your site and by you ~ which truly gave me the knowledge to pass and the confidence to know that I did. What a great program you offer and I feel really good about trusting my intuition and switching to your school program mid-stream (I was involved with another program at the time). For anybody wishing to pass their Broker's exam, they should forget all the others. I finished the first 100 questions in one hour (went back through them a second time) and I finished the next 100 questions shortly after one hour (again, had the time to go back through all the questions). During the first break, I listened to three other individuals who were really concerned about the first 100 questions ~ how they didn't know the material. John, all of those three were studying from the same school's material that I had started with myself, prior to getting your correspondence and switching! I am so excited and so very grateful. All the best,
Lynnette Blakemore


"YOUR SYSTEM OF GIVING YOU THE ANSWERS RIGHT AFTER THE QUESTION AND THEN THE RATIONAL WAS PERFECT"
I PASSED MY BROKERS. This time I studied hard, last time I thouht I could just take it since I had 25 years experience...wrong. It seems that a lot of what is on the test you do not need or use in actual practice. It requires some algebra principals, economics, history and more. I almost talked myself out of trying again for my brokers license as I was concerned that the older I get the harder it is to retain new stuff. Stuff that I most likely would never need which seemed like such as waste of time and energy. However, I found your system of giving you the answers right after the question and then the rational was perfect for me to absorbe and remember. And I learned a lot in the process, some things that will be beneficial to know. Laurie Dame

"WORTH EVERY DOLLAR. IT IS A PLEASURE TO WORK WITH THE BEST"
Hi John, Thank you for such a great quality course that, if followed as you recommend, will allow you to pass the Brokers Exam. I passed on my first try and am grateful for your course. Worth every dollar!! it is a pleasure to work with the best. Sincerely,
Don Weisman


"YOUR LESSONS ARE EASIER TO UNDERSTAND AND EXPLANATIONS ARE SIMPLE"
Hello John: Although I had less than two weeks for my broker test when I registered for the test preparation internet classes; I passed my broker test. The preparation courses were really helpful. I found the tests easier only because I took your classes. Although DRE does not send the test scores I am confident that I had over 95% score. Your lessons are easier to understand and explanations are simple. I have been talking to my peers to use Lumbleau. Once again thank you.
Pauline Shah


"AFTER FAILING THE BROKER TEST TWO TIMES USING OTHER COURSE MATERIALS I PASSED USING YOURS"
Hi John, I had taken your courses after failing the broker test two times using other course materials. I wanted to let you know that I passed using your test materials and the preparation that was necessary to make sure that I did pass. Your encouragement and telling me to postpone my test until I knew the material was very helpful. Thanks, and I know hold a Brokers License in California. Sincerely,

"MOST OF THE QUESTIONS WERE EXACTLY AS THEY WERE IN THE PRACTICE EXAMINATIONS"
I took the exam a couple of days ago and I just logged on to the DRE website. I passed confidently with 95% or higher! Most of the questions were exactly as they were in the practice examinations. The State examination seemed easy compared to the practice examinations on the course website. Thank you so much for having this course available.
Lee Hamada


"I KNOW MY SCORE WAS OVER 90%"
John: I took the broker exam in Los Angeles on January 3rd and passed. They don't tell you your score when you pass, but I know it was over 90%. Thanks. Of course I had the advantage of having been a California broker 1971-1996. The only question I ran into that I do not recall having been covered by your course was about as follows: (question added to updated questions section)

"YOUR METHOD OF TEACHING THE REQUIRED MATERIAL REALLY WORKS"
Dear John, I am so happy to let you know that myself, one of your students, just pass the broker's exam right at the first try last week Dec 19, 2007. I get the result through DRE website few minutes ago. Your method of teaching me how to learn the required material really works. It's even more amazing because I, as a computer programmer, have started my Lumbleau enrollment with literally zero background on real estate field. Thank you, thank you so much, John. Regards
Victor Tran


"I CRAMMED FOR 11 HRS. PRIOR TO TO TEST SO IT WORKED"
I PASSED STATE BROKER EXAM!!!! Thank you for your website. I didn't cover all material, however, I crammed for 11 hrs. prior to test, so it worked. I appreciate all your assistance, and will refer my other friend who wants to take his broker's to your website.

"I AM VERY PLEASE WITH YOUR COURSE"
Dear Mr. Lumbleau I just received notice that I passed my broker exam. This was my first attempt and I am very pleased with your course. Thank you for all your help.

"IT WAS THE BEST MOVE I COULD MAKE"
I took my real estate brokers test on November 14th. After studying your course I was comfortable and confident. I completed the test and double checked every answer and was finished in one hour and twenty minutes. I had taken the course from another school before and was not ready to take the test. i heard someone talking about Lumbleau so i called and signed up with you, it was the best move I could make. Thank you
Ron Brokenbrough


"I WALKED INTO MY BROKERS TEST AND ACED IT!"
I just had to say that your course helped me in a way that no other out there could. It got me into the test taking mode, and definitely was a confidence builder for me. I walked into my broker's test and ACED it! I came out feeling totally assured that I had passed. I know I had the experience and information I needed to answer the questions correctly, but the real hurdle is getting into the test taking mode after so many years of not having to. Thank you for the boost I needed to pass with flying colors!
David P Viney


"YOU EXCEEDED MY EXPECTATIONS"
Thank you Mr. Lumbleau. I learned and passed my broker exam on my first try. Thanks to your dvd's and online question and answers. Now I'm listening and watching the dvd's on How To Be A Successful Real Estate Agent that you included at no extra charge. You exceeded my expectations. I cant thank you enough. so from the botton of my heart thank you, thank you.

"MY GUESS I RECEIVED AT LEAST 90% ON THE STATE EXAM"
Hello, After taking one of your competitor's broker exam prep classes, I received your flyer in the mail. I had studied over 2000 questions, flash cards, questions on audio, etc, but I only received a 76% on your demo exam. This wasn't unacceptable as I had to pass the first time or I was going to lose an opportunity to purchase a property management business. I signed up for your broker exam prep...the difference was immediately obvious. With your examination prep, each question and answer were explained. It was really a great way to study for the exam. After going through all of your lessons (I did it in 5 days as my exam was only a week away), I received >90% on your practice exams. I took my broker exam last week, and I passed the first time. My guess is I received at least 90%. As others, each of the two sections took me a little over an hour. Many of the questions were identical. In the short term, your course gave me the confidence I needed. In the long term, I feel I now have a much more thorough understanding of the material. Another happy customer. Thank you,
Andy Wallace


"WHAT A FEELING OF ACCOMPLISHMENT"
Just wanted to drop you a line to tell you that I passed the Brokers exam on my third try. I tried two other programs that did not give me the comprehensive preparation that yours did. What a feeling of acomplishment! I could not have done it without your program. Thanks so much!
Bruce Parrish


"YOUR COURSE REALLY DOES WORK"
Yeah!!!! I took the Brokers test for the second time and PASSED with confidence, thanks to Lumbleau program and I learned a lot as well!!! Thanks Lumbleau, you were right, your course really does work...honestly!! Sincerely, A New California Broker! Yeah!
Jennifer Carter


"MOST TIMES THE QUESTIONS WERE IDENTICAL"
Dear John and the teachers at Lumbleau: I passed by California Broker's exam! I just found out five minutes ago and had to write to you immediately. Please feel free to use my email as a testimonial for your great school. The first 100 questions took me 40 minutes to finish (took it in San Diego). The proctor thought there was something wrong with me; she thought I was coming to see her about a concern or question. When I told her I was done, she looked surprised, but said "good girl!" And promptly told me I could wander around downtown for a 2 1/2 hour break. The test was like one of my many Lumbleau practice exams. Sure, a few words were changed here and there but many times, in fact most times, the questions were identical. I was thinking in my test: How did John obtain these questions?! It was amazing. The second 100 questions took me 45 minutes to complete. Then the proctor told me: "you really knew what you were doing!" And I did. I walked out of the room and into the ladies room, crying. I was crying because I knew I had passed. In fact, I would guess that I passed with a 90% score or higher. Again, the second half had so many identical questions to the Lumbleau chapter tests and/or practice exams. I became a huge fan of John Lumbleau by watching his DVDs while sitting at open houses or at my home office. His stories are very important. He's a legacy and a legend, and I consider him a Califoria icon. For the students who have wondered where to take your prep courses, you are done wondering. You must, simply must, purchase the Lumbleau course. What worked best for me was purchasing the whole thing for the broker prep, which included all 14 DVDs and the book (and the successful selling DVDs, which I will watch now). And please don't short cut yourself on time. I took two full months, granted it was part time, but I took two months to complete everything. I took one full week for practice exams. John, thank you. You just changed my career. Sincerely,
Kimberly Dotseth


"THE COST OF YOUR MATERIALS IS WAY TOO REASONABLE"
I just found out that I passed my broker exam and it was my first attempt. I sincerely thank you for the great materials: the combination of your text, the videos and review questions, all of which encouraged me to work hard to get through the exam the first time. Your videos, besides covering the subject matter, is very motivational. The cost for all the materials is way too reasonable. Thanks again.

"I KNEW THE MATERIAL COLD"
Dear John, The good news is, I passed the broker’s exam the first time out on 10/10/2007. I knew the material cold, but the test was very tricky and difficult.. 75% of that room looked like deer caught in the headlights! I finished the exam first in both morning and afternoon sessions and was out in 50 minutes on the second half. Thank you for your great system. I will surely refer your company to anyone I know.

"YOUR VIDEOS QUIZES AND TESTS WERE SUPERIOR AND UP TO DATE"
John, I started my quest with a diffrent company, this was a big mistake. The other company guided me through the requirements to take the broker test but failed to follow through with what it takes to pass. I failed my first attempt and then found your course on the internet. The other company merely sent booklets and tests with answers. Your Videos, Quizes and Tests where superior and up to date. I just took the test 9/6/07 and many of your test questions were on the state exam!! The guidence and knowledge you provided were worth at least 500.00. I look forward to watching your "Success" video soon. C Keller Williams Tri Valley Real Estate Pleasanton, CA 94588

"YOUR COURSE WAS A LIFE SAVER"
Hi John, I just checked on line and I passed the exam. Yippee! Thank you again. Your course was a life saver. I need my Real Estate License for Property Management. But when I got serious like you said we needed too. I applied myself and did all of your courses and the tests. When I set down to take the test I was actually very relaxed! Again Thank you!
Eva Raleigh


"WHAT A WONDERFUL EXPERIENCE IT WAS ACEING THE TEST WITH YOUR MATERIAL"
Dear Mr. Lumbleau, I could not believe it when I opened up the first page of the brokers test. It was like I was looking at the update you provided a few days before my exam. I had the feeling something was wrong I finished the test so quickly and the others were still taking the test. What a wonderful experience it was preparing for the test with your material and aceing the test with that material. I am so glad I came back to get my brokers license 18 years after you helped me get my salespersons license. Thanks again I tell every one about the course. My aunt is studying and my daughter used you to get her license a couple years back. Once again thanks, Austell Cowley

"THE MOMENT I LEFT THE TESTING ROOM I KNEW 100% THAT I PASSED"
LUMBLEAU REAL ESTATE SCHOOL is the only school to go! I just passed my Broker Exam taken on 8/8/2007. I am extremely happy to see the result today 8/14/2007 "Congratulations" that's it. This is my first attempt.Two weeks before my scheduled exam, I got a flyer from Lumbleau, I checked it on line and right away I made a decision to enroll. The way they present the course is so easy and simple to understand. It gave me so much confidence and feeling ahead of everybody. The moment I left the testing room I know 100% that I passed. Thank you so much Mr Lumbleau...I already gave your website to four (4) people that did not pass the same test. Again, thank you and God Bless You.

"YOUR PREP COURSE REALLY HONED IN ON ONLY THE INFORMATION NEEDED TO PASS"
I passed my broker's exam on August 2nd!!! I was very shocked to see quite a few of the practice questions on the actual exam. There is no doubt your exam prep course helped me pass the exam. With the plethora of information to study in the required pre-exam courses, your prep courses really honed in on only the pertinent information needed to pass. I am recommending you to everyone I know that wants a RE license.
Laura Penn-Barahona


"I THOUGHT I WAS A LOST CAUSE UNTIL I FOUND LUMBLEAU"
Hi. I just wanted you to know that I passed the California Broker's Exam. I believe your crash course was the reason! The online tests were amazing because they have detailed explanations for right and wrong answers. If a student reads each chapter and answers all the questions until he/she gets them all right, there's no reason he/she cannot pass. I thought I was a lost case until I found LUMBLEAU!
Jennifer Delson


"YOU ARE MY REAL ESTATE SCHOOL FOR LIFE "
Dear John, I am grateful for the mailer that you sent to my home just 2 weeks prior to my scheduled exam for Broker licensing. I threw it away and my husband picked it up and read every word. He asked me to take a second look. I was one of those who had paid three times the cost and attended a competing online broker prep course. On reviewing your add I determined "no harm in taking Lumbleau also!" On receiving your online course, I began to work through the 14 lessons. They were much harder and I went from feeling fully prepared with the other school... to panicking that I would not have time to work my way through all of the Lumbleau lessons and exams. On arriving at the exam, I met many others who were there for the second and third time and who had attended some of your competing schools. The Broker exam was hard! None of the questions were worded quite the same; but, I knew the answers because your lessons prepared me and gave me a clear understanding of the concepts and laws. On July 20th...I passed on the first try!!! I thank you so much for your internet and your personal phone support. You are my R.E. school for life and I am already sharing my story with others who may benefit by your services. Most Sincerely,
Susan Frost


"THE QUESTIONS ON YOUR PRACTICE EXAMS WERE JUST LIKE THE EXAM QUESTIONS"
John, I passed the broker's test. Loved the programs and your system. Watched over a period of some weeks and even in two hotel rooms on trips - very easy to do and great use of that time. The questions in your practice exams were just like the exam questions, but more importantly I learned the material from your tapes and the follow-along book -- that's the important thing. Thanks a lot John. Nicely Done. Yours,
Richard Russell


"YOUR QUESTIONS MADE ME FEEL SO CONFIDENT"
I took the CA broker exam on July 19th and today I checked on the DRE website, I PASSED! This . Thanks for the 3,000+ questions. They are really useful and helpful. They made me feel so confident of taking the exam. Nory from Alhambra, CA

"IT PREPARED ME WELL"
Thank you for your course. It prepared me well and I passed the Brokers Exam that I took on 7/10/2007.

"I WAS AMOUNG THE FIRST FOUR OR FIVE TO FINISH EACH SESSION"
I just got the results from my broker's exam from July 13th and I passed. Before the exam, the proctor proudly announced that they were using a completely "new" test. Once I was into it, it was clear that some re-wording had been done, but even at that, I recognized most of the questions. As with my earlier salesperson's exam, I was among the first four or five people (out of 85) to finish each session. This is two state exams that I have taken with your help, and can say that if anyone is willing to put in the time, you deliver a product that makes passing the state exams (broker or salesperson) a reality. Keep up the great program - I'll be back for my continuing education. Regards and Thanks,
Harold Fraser


"YOUR STYLE OF TEACHING AND QUESTIONS VERY SIMILAR TO THE TEST MODE MADE IT EASY"
Thank you Lumbleau!!! I passed!!!! The first course I took was from another agency and when I got to the exam, I discovered most of the question on the test were not in my studies and missed passing with 71%. Your style of teaching and questions very similar the the test made it easy to answer questions and this time I was able to do more math questions with confidence!!! Your the Best!!!

"YOUR EXAM PREP COURSES MADE BROKER STATE EXAM EASY"
Your exam prep courses made broker state exam EASY!!! For those of you already hesitating to purchase course in order to save money-THINK AGAIN. Also, the rationales and videos used to explain subject matter made the material a lot easier to understand. I'm looking foward to watching success videos next week after I return home from a real estate seminar.

"I FOUND IT EASY TO STUDY WITH YOUR USER FRIENDLY COURSE"
I just wanted to let you know that I passed my brokers exam on the first try thanks to you. I found it easy to study with your user friendly course. I only had about 2 weeks to study and felt confident after leaving the DRE state exam. Thank you very much and I look forward to taking my continuing ed with you in the future and recommending your courses to my friends. 
Sheralyn Kirby


"GREAT PREPARATION"
Dear John Lumbleau, I PASSED!!! Thank you so much . This was great preparation. At the actual DRE test, it almost seemed like I had seen the questions before Thanks again,
Hartmut Eggert


"THANKS FOR MAKING IT SUPER-EASY TO PASS MY BROKER'S EXAM"
A million thanks to Lumbleau Real Estate Schools for getting me the courses needed for my broker's exam and a huge thanks for making it super-easy to pass my broker's exam! The best part: I've never worked in the real estate industry but you helped me reach the top all at once. I failed the first time but that was due to my having to take care of my newborn daughter and not being able to devote enought time to study. The second time I aced it! Thanks John! Sincerely,
Keith Baldwin


"I PASSED WITH AT LEAST 90% OR MORE IN MY OPINION"
I took xxxxxx Schools class and studied for two months three hours a day and was getting 97% on the practice exams going it- I was prepared- I thought until I got a 74%!!! It took me 4.5 hours and it was the worst experience of my life. I then took your course and I studied and finished the exam in 1hour each session (the first one out). I finished so early I began second guessing myself. I have never failed an exam before so I took it very personally. I passed with at least 90% or more in my opinion .
Randy Geniec


"YOU HELPED ME TREMENDOUSLY"
Dear Mr. Lumbleau, A dear friend of mine recommended the Lumbleau course to me. I took her advice and went for it. I took the broker exam on 5/16/2007, and passed it on the first attempt. I am very pleased and must admit that Lumbleau real estate exam preparation course and the Lumbleau method of teaching helped me tremendously and well prepared me in my successful passing. I have to say that I felt very calm and confident when leaving the exam site, because I knew I did well. Thank you so much. I am so grateful that I have come to the right source. I would recommend to anyone without hesitation to take your courses, they are excellent.

"THE LUMBLEAU SCHOOL HAMMERS THE INFORMATION HOME IN A WAY NO OTHER SCHOOL DOES"
Lumbleau School, I wanted to thank the school for assisting me in passing the exam finally. I have failed 4 times (72%,70%,71%) with the assistance of a competing school, but as others have said, I felt like I knew the material anyway, but the Lumbleau School assists and educates you in a manner designed to help you pass the exam. I literally knew many of the questions on the exam. The Lumbleau school hammers the information home in a way that literally no other school does. I am very impressed and happy and hopefully on my way to a brilliant career in Real Estate Brokerage. Thanks Again
L Duncan


"YOUR SYSTEM HAD ME COMPLETELY COACHED AND READY"
Dear Mr. Lumbleau, A quick note of thanks for your wonderful course. In all of the tests I have taken over the years, I have never felt as confident as I did when I took the broker exam. Your system had me completely coached up and ready. Thank you.
Richard Snowden


"I ONLY STUDIED THE THREE DAYS PRIOR TO THE EXAM AND JUST YOUR MATERIAL"
I recently took the broker exam and passed on my first attempt thanks to your school. I only studied the three days prior to my exam and studied just your material that was provided from your school. I just wanted to say ‘thank you’ for putting together such an effective approach and lesson plan and wanted to let you know that if you needed a testimonial or endorsement I’d be more than happy to give one.
Albert Lopez


"THANK YOU FOR SUCH A GREAT COURSE"
Hi, I signed up at the last minute for your Broker course. I took the test on May 17, 2007. I studied to the last minute. I am proud to say that all the time an effort paid off. I passed on the first attempt. Thank you for such a great course.
Mary Ann Russo


"I PASSED WITH YOUR COURSE DEEPLY ENGRAINED IN MY BRAIN"
Mr Lumbleau, I am positive you hear compliments about your course constantly, and I am sure I will be simply added to your multiple statistics touting your undeniable success... But, in all sincerity I just wanted to say thanks! I passed the Broker test with your course deeply engrained in my brain. I knew (like your ads say) I had passed before I left the testing facility. Thanks again and I am confident I will become a great success. Thanks Again!
Steve Jeffers


"YOU ARE TRULY A BLESSING"

"YOU GAVE ME THE POWER TO KEEP GOING"
Hello Mr. Lumbleau, I want to thank you for your DVDs and your instructions from bottom of my heart. You give me such a power to keep on going with a positive attitude. I always thought, I am not a good sales person but after listening to you, I have changed the way I look at the things and the things started to change. God Bless and thank you again.

"THE TEST PROCTOR SAID SO FEW PEOPLE PASS THE FIRST TIME - I PASSED!"
Hi John, I PASSED THE TEST!!!! My husband is planning to take your course next. . Thank you for helping me pass the test. The test proctor told me that she would see me next time (because so few people pass the first time) and I assured her that I already passed! Thanks again, Joan Tortorici--passed the first time

"I PASSED WITH CONFIDENCE"
Dear Mr. Lumbleau, I took the broker's exam on Monday, 5/7/07 and passed it with confidence. Your system is really good and it works! I passed (at first try). Thank you so much!
Naama Baifus


"YOUR STUDY SYSTEM REALLY WORKS"
I just received notice that I passed my broker exam. I took it a month ago after using a different school's study material. I got a 71% on my first try, but really did not feel a whole lot of confidence. I ordered your study material just two weeks before retaking the exam and knew when I left the building that I had passed. The test seemed much easier and I felt like I knew a majority of the answers. Your study system really works! Thanks! Teresa Petty
Teresa Petty


"I FEEL LIKE DANCING ON AIR"
I want to sincerely thank John & the staff at Lumbleau Schools for their help in passing my state exam. While the test was difficult & tricky I did pass and was confident when I left that I passed. I failed miserably on my first attempt and couldn't haved passed with xxxxxx Schools exam prep even if it was an open book test book. I should have known better as it was glossy and flashy and the most expensive one. The Lumbleau way is the only way to go. John was patient to answer all my questions and his motivational speeches kept me on track to put in the study time. If you want to pass you must put in the hours but it is alll worth it in the end when you get that passing grade. God Bless you John as I feel like dancing on air right now.
Kevin Dougan


"ACQUIRING YOUR PACKAGE JUST A WEEK PRIOR TO THE TEST -... I PASSED"
Mr. Lumbleau, Just a note to let you know that "despite your misgivings" about my "late entry into the fray" and acquiring your package just a week prior to the test - I'm pleased to let you know that I have (in fact) passed. If I can let others know of the value of your excellent courses and how they will prepare - even the procrastinator amongst us - please let me know. Thank you, Gary M. Archibald
Gary M. Archibald


"THE TEST WAS SO EASY I ALMOST FELT LIKE I WAS CHEATING!"
Lumbleau YOU ROCK!!! The test was so easy, I almost felt like I was cheating! Anyone reading this and considering taking the broker exam, DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND TAKE THIS PREP COARSE, YOU WILL PASS!
Michael Woodall


"I KNEW I PASSED AS SOON AS I LEFT THE BUILDING"
Thank you so much for all your help! I had taken the broker exam twice with 2 different companies. ( xxxxxx and xx xxxxI failed both and what's even worse is that I knew I failed as soon as I finished. I just took the exam on the 26th of February. I knew I passed as soon as I lelft the building! And I was right. I just got the result online from the state. In fact, I was a little surprised at how I thought the exam was quite easy! You were right Mr. Lumbleau! All I had to do was follow your course outline and forget about those other people. They must be teaching either the wrong subject matter or their method just isn't the correct way. Your method makes so much more sense! Thank you again! I am so relieved and happy.
Rick de la Cruz


"I WAS VERY SMOOTH"
Thank you John I passed my state broker exam. I was very smooth. I am glad I came by to your training. Thank you again,
Ann Wilson


"YOU MADE IT POSSIBLE FOR ME TO BREEZE THROUGH THE EXAM, AND WITH A CONFIDENCE THAT I PASSED IT"
Just found out I passed the Broker's exam. I am so glad to have found your school. I purchased another program but something told me that it was missing my ability to understand the rationale behind the answers. I was simply memorizing answers and the presentation was so disorganized. You are a great trainer and I must acknowledge you. You made it possible for me to breeze through the exam, and with a confidence that I passed it. Thanks John.
Gerry Viceral


"YOUR COURSE MADE ME FEEL CONFIDENT WHEN I WALKED IN AND OUT OF THE DRE TESTING ROOM"

"I FINALLY PASSED. I HAVE GONE THROUGH OTHER SCHOOLS,THERE WAY JUST DID NOT CUT IT."
Mr. Lumbleau, I just want to thank you so much for your program. After so many tries, I finally passed. I have gone through other schools, their way just did not quite cut it. I have to attribute my passing to the "Lumbleau" method and material! You need to study the "right" material to pass this exam! Again, many thanks to you from me and my family! Now, I can actually start making a living for my family!

"THERE WASN'T A SINGLE QUESTION ON THE EXAM THAT WAS NOT COIVERED BY YOUR COURSE"
I recently completed the exam for my real estate brokers license, and have receive notice that I passed. Thank you for creating such a wonderful learning system. I feel confident I got at least 90% or better. There wasn't a single question on the exam that was not covered by your course. And although I methodically and deliberately read each question on the exam, I was still one of the first people to complete my exam. Best! Best! Best!
Thomas Lindstrom


"IT WAS A PIECE OF CAKE"
I just passed my RE broker exam with ease after studying your 14 classes and pre-exam questions in the last 3 weeks. I don't know how could anyone pass this exam without going through your study program. This was a very hard test with many trick questions but having gone through your 14 classes, study questions and pre-exam questions it was a piece of cake! I highly recommend Lumbleau's sales and broker exam material to anyone trying to get into real estate. There is no other way! Thank you so much,
Bijan Sheikhvand


I passed my exam on January 11, 2007 due to the Lumbleau system. Thank you for developing such an awesome key to passing the Broker Exam.

Hi Mr. Lumbleau, Thank you for all your excellent training... I passed my brokers January 16th 2007. More than that I learned alot about real estate I did not know before. You and your training, are a credit to the real estate industry. Thank you

"WHEN YOU WANT TO KNOW GO TO LUMBLEAU"
Dear John, I'm a licensed California Real Estate Broker! Thanks to you. With only 3 1/2 hours sleep the night before my exam, I passed on my first try! The updates were great to have but what I really appreciate about your exam preparation (and I just studied from the questions) is that I feel like I really know and understand so much about California Real Estate law now that during the exam when I was going through the questions that I initially didn't know "for sure" I could relax and eliminate the wrong answers to either narrow it down to 2 or come up with the right one. This confidence came from studying those 3000 questions (I tagged half for review) and reading the "rationale". You really taught me what a Broker needs to know and I feel like I really earned that license. For that I thank you! Just like your other testimonials say, there was a woman at the break who said to me: Didn't you think that was HARD???" I just said, "Actually I feel pretty good, whose course did you study from?" She named some name and I just said "If you want to pass next time, write this down: Lumbleau!" Here's your new slogan John: "When you want to know, get Lumbleau!" Thank you again for your excellent school!
Mary Anne S. Daly


"YOUR PRELUDE TO EACH LESSON ALWAYS PUSHED ME HARDER TO GET IT DONE"
Dear Mr. Lumbleau, THANK YOU for making my study for the real estate licensee exam enjoyable and informative. More importantly, your inspirational prelude to each lesson always pushed me a just little harder to get it done. The test that I took on December 8th, 2006 I passed, I unhesitatingly recommend your program to anyone considering taking the test. Thanks Mr. Lumbleau, You are a blessing!!

Dear Mr. Lumbleau, Thought you might want to know, I just got the results of my brokers exam -- I passed. I will definitely recommend your course to others. Larry Ochsner

Mr. Lumbleau, Thank you for your advices and well presented broker course which led to my first attempt and guaranteed passage of the broker exam. Merci beaucoup!
Alhinolah Nshimba


"THE BEST PART WAS WALKING INTO THE STATE EXAM AND RECOGNIZING SO MANY QUESTIONS"
Thank you for helping me pass the broker's test the first time. I went from nervous to confident in the three weeks that I started taking your course. The question and answer format is the best way to learn. The repeated subjects within subjects is great for reinforcing concepts. The best part was walking into the exam and recognizing so many questions -- even when there was a "twist" to the choices. Your answers had described the reasoning so well that I had no trouble with finding the twist and then the right choice. Keep up the good work!
James Wong


"I WAKED OUT WITH NO DOUBT I PASSED"
Just wanted to thank you for helping me pass. I took the test on October 23, 2006 and walked out with no doubt that I had passed, just had to wait to confirm it with DRE... thanks again

"I COULD NOT HAVE DONE IT WITHOUT YOUR PROGRAM"
Hello: I wanted to thank you so much for your help on passing my state exam for brokers. I COULD NOT have done it with out your program and update, thank you,
Fera HASHEMI


"I RECOGNIZED ALMOST ALL THE QUESTIONS ON THE EXAM"
Mr. Lumbleau, I purchased your broker exam study course only 2 1/2 weeks before the exam. I did not have time to completely finish the course, but focused on the areas that I knew I was deficient in. When I took the exam I was so surprised that I recognized almost all the questions on the exam. I was not surprised when I got my results and I PASSED! I had taken a different company's course several months ago and did not pass at that time, and it was not because I did not study. Keep up the good work.
Debra Carlisle


"TOOK COURSE WITH ONLY TWO WEEKS REMAINING PRIOR TO MY EXAM AND PASSED"
Mr. Lumbleau, I purchased your exam w/ only two weeks remaining prior to my exam date. The broker course was thourough and comprehensive and made my studies simple. To my surprise, I recognized many of the questions on the state exam from the practice exams I took from you. I passed my brokers exam on the first attempt. I highly recommend your course to anyone seeking to pass the broker state exam in California. Thank you so much, you're the best! Sincerely,
Chris Caballero


"LOOK AROUND THE EXAM ROOM TO SEE IF OTHERS FIND IT AS EASY AS YOU"
Good morning John - Thank you for providing a needed exam preparation school. I was a non believer at first. The steps to being a new broker: 1. Feel nervous about taking the exam 2. Pay $89 to lumbleau.com 3. Study until the exam questions with answers are obvious and know why they are correct. 4. Drive safely to examination room on exam day 5. Look around the exam room to see if others find it as easy as you. 6. Drive safely home with a smile. 7. Sleep like a baby. 8. Wake up next morning with a smile. 9. Check DRE website for "NOTE: You passed the Broker examination on blah blah date." 10. Call John and thank him, his employees and previous students. 14. Start or continue your career in real estate. Thank you again, Robert S.robertmayhelp@yahoo.com

"I COULD NOT HAVE PASSED WITHOUT THE LUMBLEAU COURSE"
I passed my RE Broker Exam- first try. As of Oct 5 I am officially a broker. It is a very tough test. I could not have passed it without the Lumbleau course. Thanks !

"HAD FAITH IN YOUR COURSE FROM THE START"
I passed my Broker's exam!!!!! Thank you so much. I had faith in your course from the start. (WE) did it!
Terri Ingram


"IT REALLY WORKS"
Thanks, Lumbleau! I passed the broker exam on the first try. It was especially helpful to review the exam updates right before the exam. Some students might think that it is overkill to review and study 3,000 questions, but it really works. Thanks again,
Adam Sragovicz


"OF THE FIRST 100 QUESTIONS THERE WERE ONLY 16 FOR WHICH I DID NOT ABSOLUTELY KNOW"
Just wanted to let you know that I passed my Broker's exam on the first try after using the $89.00 Broker study program. Your process is just the way I like to study for exams. Reviewing the almost 4000 questions (including lesson questions, practice exams & updates) was a good refresher for me and I felt very prepared for the exam. During the morning break, I saw a lot of people "cramming" for the second half of the test, and commenting on how hard the first half had been. For me, of the first 100 questions, there were only 16 for which I didn't absolutely know the answer, but think I probably got some of those correct, too. I ran into several people that were on their 2nd to 4th time retaking the test. The study program was GREAT!!! Thanks.
Arlene Day


"I WENT THRU YOUR COURSE AS RECOMMENDED AND PASSED"
Hello John, I'm pleased to annouce I PASSED my brokers exam on 08/23/2006. I tried to take a short cut and not study the full course, that did'nt work. So, I went thru your course as recommeded and I passed. Thank you John for providing this easy to understand course to pass the exam. I will recommed your course to every realtor I know.
Janice Pierce


"THE COURSE YOU OFFERED HAD ABOUT 75% OF THE STATE EXAM QUESTIONS"
Dear Mr. Lumbleau, I thank you for your great school better than any other R.E schools . The courses you offerred were great about 75 % of the State Exam Questions came . I passed my broker test on 08-25-2006 Thank you again and I did refer two guys to sign with you. And I will in the near future refer every person I know taking the Bro Exam or Sales Exam . God Bless My best regards to you, your staff and your school .

"I'M A PERSON WHO NEEDS TO KNOW THE "WHY" ON THINGS AND YOU PROVIDE IT"
Hi, John, Well, you can add me to your list of glowing testimonials. I took the broker exam on 8/23 and found out on-line with DRE that I passed - today is 8/25. Your materials are really right on target-just my speed as I'm a person who needs to know the "why" on things and you provide it.. Thanks so much again for being there. You've been around a long time now, and obviously there's a good reason for that - you have mastered your craft! Warmest wishes,

"YOUR EXPLANATIONS WERE CRITICAL AS TO UNDERSTANDING THE CONTENT OF THE MATERIAL"
Hi John,I want to personally thank you for your materials and in-depth videos. Your explanations were critical as to understanding the content of the material.

" I WAS AMAZE AT HOW SIMPLE IT WAS TO UNDERSTAND YOUR COURSES"
HI, I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU MR. LUMBLEAU FOR HELPING ME PASS MY BROKER EXAM. I HAVE BEEN A REAL ESTATE AGENT FOR ALMOST FIVE YEARS, AND WANTED TO BECOME A BROKER. I TRY AND FAIL THE BROKER EXAM THREE TIMES, BEFORE SOME IN MY OFFICE TOLD ME ABOUT YOUR SCHOOL. I ORDER THE DVD AND PASSING COURSE AND WAS AMAZE AT HOW SIMPLE IT WAS TO UNDERSTAND YOUR COURSES. THANK YOU, I WILL RECOMMEND THIS TO EVERYONE I KNOW THAT WANT TO PASS THE STATE EXAM.
JACQUELINE MOSLEY


"I WALKED OUT OF THE ROOM KNOWING I HAD PASSED. IT WAS A BREEZE WHICH WAS OPPOSITE TO MY FIRST EXPERIENCE"
I wanted to write a quick thank you for your Broker exam passing course. This was my second time taking the exam. 1 month prior to my exam date, I received a flyer explaining your Broker passing classes. I thought I would give it a shot and what a great decision it was! Your method of questions and answers helped me to really understand the information versus trying to memorize without really grasping the concept. I studied for two weeks up until my exam date and was scoring high on your practice exams. After my test was completed, I walked out of the room knowing that I had passed. It was a breeze which was opposite of my first experience. I will recommend Lumbleau to everyone I know! I could not have done this without your class. Thanks again.
Carrie Martin Luebcke


Just wanted to say thanks. Passed my broker's exam first try!

"YOUR PERSONAL TUTCH ANSWERING QUESTIONS AND YOUR MOTIVATIONAL GUIDENCE HAS MADE THIS COURSE VERY REWARDING"
Hi John, Here is another testimonial to add to your Broker's course success list. I passed my State Broker's Exam on the first time!!! I cannot recommend your course enough. If I, a single Mom with 4 kids, working full time in a large corporation can take your course and pass, then I think anyone determined enough, can do it. My brother was very excited to hear that I passed my exam and I have recommended this course to him. Now, he is on his way to learning the Lumbleau Way...the only way :). Thank-you, John. Your personal touch in answering questions on the phone yourself, the creation of the videos and your motivational guidance has made taking this course very rewarding...Much Kudos go to you in helping so many of us reach our goals! Thanks Again!!!
Josephine Cheng


"THE KNOWLEDGE I RECEIVED FROM LUMBLEAU SCHOOL WAS FAR SUPERIOR TO ANY OTHER THAT I STUDIED"
Hello John, I would like to just thank you for the courses and the products you provided to me; the knowledge that I received from lumbleau school was by far superior to any other one that I studied, and it caused me to pass the broker exam and now I am in the process of getting my license. Thanks to you for being there with my questions and thanks to lumbleau school for helping me achieving one of my goals. Regards,
Sam Khadivi


"WHEN I TOOK THE TEST YOUR PREPARATION MADE IT SEEM EASY"
I wanted to thank you for your excellent course. I passed the Brokers Exam with ease. It was my second time. The first time I didn't prepare at all... Then I studied using your online course and when I took the test your preparation made it seem easy. Thanks again.
David McDonnell


"NO ONE ELSE I TALKED TO THAT DAY PASSED"
This is a very good prep course for the broker's exam. I passed the first time and no one else I talked to, that took the test that day, passed. I've already referred others to you. Thanks,
Dan Tosh


"HARD WORK AND YOUR EXCELLENT STUDY PROGRAM IS A WINNING COMBINATION"
Add me to your passed statistics!! I DID IT! Hard work and your excellent study program is a winning combination. Most of the people taking the test were on at least their second attempt. I passed the broker exam on my first time thanks to your program.
Laura Brandon


"I COULD NOT HAVE DONE IT WITHOUT YOU"
John... I passed my broker's exam, yeah! Thanks a million, I could not have done it without you. Now my daughter and her boyfriend are taking your courses.
Lee Lovitt


"I KEPT THINKING "I JUST STUDIED ALL THIS STUFF LAST NIGHT IN THE UPDATES""
John, your course did the trick. I passed the Broker exam. The exam was very difficult but your updates were right on. During the exam, I kept thinking "I just studied all this stuff last night in the updates". It gave me a lot of confidence about passing and I was very relaxed. Thanks for your comprehensive course.
Ron Holden


I PASSED! Thanks for your material and study guides. I just wished I had your material a year ago.
Terry Osburn


Dear Mr. Lumbleau: I just found out that I passed the Broker Exam!!! I just wanted to say--Thank You! I read other course material and they did not compare with regards to the information you provided. I especially enjoyed your messages on "Dedication" and "Success" prior to beginning the lessons. You are a natural teacher. When I took the exam the material was right on. Your video lectures and the exams helped me retain the information. I had over 1.5 hours of extra time left on each section of the broker exam. I had so much time left over that I thought I may have rushed through the exam. However, deep down inside I "knew" the answers and I "knew" I had done well. As I launch my career, you can bet I will be using your services for future training and for the training of my sales people. My deepest thanks,
Victor Arellano


John: I just to let you know that following your advice (just do the questions), I easily passed the Broker exam the first time. I spent about 40 minutes each session answering the 100 questions. Many of those questions I had seen before; only about 10 % seemed like new material. In any event, thank you, your course and advice were great. 
Alan Yockelson


Hi John, I have been a licensed full time salesperson since 1986. When I decided to finally work at getting my Brokers license last year, Several new agents that where in that first office I worked in 20 years ago went to Lumbleau and raved about how great it was. You would usually pick up the phone. You helped me though a couple of rough spots and I passed my Brokers exam the first time on June 10th. Thanks again.
John Doug Solwick


John, I have to share the great news with you right away. I took my broker test on Saturday June 10. I PASSED IN MY VERY FIRST TRY !!!! THANK YOU ... THANK YOU ... THANK YOU!!!! I know I could not have done it without your help and constant encouragement. With 2 weeks left for the test I found out that either my DVD's had been packed away or they were lost. I called your office and explained my dilemma. You sent me the replacement DVD's and gave me a 25 % discount. I received the DVD's in 2 days flat and started hitting the books and DVD's. My wife can attest that I watched every DVD except # 14 and I did the practices that you requested. At test time I felt pretty good but not 100% sure. I thought that if I had really taken the time to prepare myself at least 30 days prior to the test there would be no chance at all of me failing. Thanks again for helping me pass this very important test. Please, feel free to use my e-mail as a testimonial and provide my contact information to anyone wanting to verify the validity of your claims. GOD BLESS YOU JOHN!

Dear John, I want to say I passed the broker exam on the first try May 20, 2006 with no previous experience in real estate! I absolutely could not have done it without the Lumbleau course. I initially began another weekend prep course and then postponed my original exam date after discovering the depth and breadth of the Lumbleau course. Thank you John for preparing me so well. Your methodology works and your lectures make the material comprehensible and interesting. A lot of the questions on the exam were recognizable and “easy” after doing all the Lumbleau practice tests. I studied really hard and felt very prepared. Your pep talks on the videos kept me going. I now plan to really study the success videos to get started in my new career. I cannot recommend this course enough. Don’t even THINK of taking the State Broker exam without it.
Pamela Papas


It's hard to believe that I am writing a testimonial, since it was just a few weeks ago I was so sceptical about passing the exam. I got the news last night that I "Passed the Broker's emam"! I am so greatful. Thanks Mr. Lumbleau.
Caperulita Ndikum


Hi John: Just wanted to tell you that I PASSED my exam. Your program did the trick. thanks.
Libby Weatherby


John, I did it. Thanks John from the bottom of my heart. Your course is the best. I felt very confident while taking the test because you taught me the material. I was amazed at how well prepared I was during the test. To all of you who are reading these testimonials,choose the Lumbleau program it is second to none. Another word of advice, it does take sacrifice and hard work to pass the exam. I studied about 1 1/2 to 3 hours a day for a month but I will tell you that the exam that after putting in the time the test was so easy. I had to double check the answers not because I was unsure of my selection but because I was able to answer very quickly. I feel a debt of gratitude to John Lumbleau so I offer my contact information through my website. Feel free to call or email for my personal recommendation. www.louisfong.com. John thank you for blessing me with your years of knowledge. I will now move to the next phase of my career.
Louis Fong


Dear Mr. Lumbleau, Unbelievable! You have absolutely the best test preparation for the state exam that I've seen. I passed my Broker's exam on the first try EASILY with your help. Because your program helped me weed out those questions that gave me trouble, I was able to ensure I knew them for the test. And boy did it work. I saw so many of them on the exam it was just too easy for me! I felt so confident after having taken the test that I recommended your course to several people who had taken only a "weekend crash course" who felt that the test was so hard they would surely fail it. I told them don't worry, just take Lumbleau's course and you'll pass next time! Thanks again for all your help!!
Robert Pearson


Hello Mr. Lumbeau. I just wanted to let you know that after using your online Broker Exam Questions for less than three weeks, I was able to pass the CA Broker Exam!! I actually was logged onto your site using my cell phone as I travel across country with my with asking the questions and checking the answers online. We drove staight to the test and I felt confident when I walked out of the proctored exam. Your online product is more user friendly and much more comprehensive that the other online schools. I have used. I will recommend you services to my employees with confidence. Thank you John! 
Tony Baricevic


DEAR JOHN, I PASSED MY EXAM ON 4/22/06!!! I WOULD LIKE TO SINCERELY THANK YOU FOR ALL THE PREPARATION THAT YOU PROVIDED ME. HAD I LISTEN TO YOU BEFORE, I WOULD NOT HAVE GONE THROUGH ALL THOSE OTHER PROGRAMS, WASTED TIME AND MONEY PREPAREING MYSELF. COMPLETING THE THE COURSE WITH YOU MADE LEARNING FUN, AND ENJOYABLE ! THANKS AGAIN AND I WILL REFER YOUR COURSE TO OTHERS!!! SINCERELY,
LYNDA B. HASSAN


Mr. Lumbleau, I just want to thank you for the way your exam preparation course prepared me for my State Broker exam. I just checked the DRE website and and found that I had passed my Broker exam. I was a little embarrased, because I Finished my morning session of the exam in about 1 hour 15 minutes. The other half of the exam I finished in 1 hour and 10 minutes. I just felt confident that I had passed, no question about it. Once again, thank you so much for all your help, I couldn't have done it without you. Sincerely
John Ramirez


I just found out I passed the broker's exam that was given 3/21/06! It was my first attempt. Your method of teaching actually made the experience enjoyable. I had previously tried to study with another company's study materials. It was just a 9 inch thick outline that one was to read in time for a 2 day weekend crash course. It was such a dreadful experience I ended up cancelling my exam. I rescheduled it and enrolled in your course. I'm really glad I did. Thank you!
Shari Sveningson, Esq.


I passed!! Our test was at least 5x better than the tests in the book from the other school I mentioned to you previously. Thanks again for your guidance through this process of becoming a Real Estate Broker!!
Debra Simon


Hello Mr. Lumbleau, I just wanted to let you know that I passed the broker exam that I took on 3/9/06. I just checked my record on DRE website and found that out. I can't believe I passed since I did not have any experience in real estate. All I did was studying your broker exam passing courses faithfully for two months. I just can't believe it!!! Any way, I really enjoyed your lectures and your wonderful motivational stories! I'll definitely pass on your name to other people and come back for continuing education courses. Thank you so much for everything!!!
Julia Lee


Good morning! I wanted to take a moment to thank you . I took my broker exam on Feb 22 , 2006 . Not only did I pass the exam but I also I felt very knowledgeable and confident about the subject matter thanks to your course . I really enjoyed the videos and John's motivational talks. I will continue using your school for continuing education courses and will reccomend your school to anyone whithout any reservation . Again , thank you.
Peter Salomone


I just wanted to let you know I passed the broker exam on the 1st try. Thank you so much for your great exam passing course! I definitely recommend your courses to anyone preparing for the real estate exams.

David Murphy


I just wanted you know that your study material was very helpful and had helped me to pass the broker exam on 02/07/06. I studied hard but it well paid off. Most of the questions were similar to the test that I took and I will definitely recomend your study material to anyone. Thank you for preparing us well for the exam.
Linh Vo


Thank you for the personal attention. Each time I had a question about the test, study advice, or application questions you always emailed me a quick reply. I passed my Broker exam 1st time on January 18th! Thank you for helping!
Valerie George


I passed! I made the mistake of studying with the xxxxxxx.com software on the first go round and only 50% of the material was covered. Then I paid John 89 bucks to give me most of the answers. It was a breeze. 70% of the material on the test was identical to what I studied. Thanks for my brokers license John. I could have never passed without you!
Phil Stephenson


Hi Mr. Lumbleau, I am happy to announce that I have passed the broker's exam that I took for the first time on January 6, 2006. Thanks for the excellent course. Thank you very much.
Luke Cheng


Just wanted to let you know I passed the California DRE Broker's exam on the first try after completeing you Broker Prep Course. Others at the exam had used other schools and were hoping to pass after 2 or 3 attempts. Your course contained up to date questions and was easy to understand. Thanks for putting together such a great course.
Robert Bennett


1/13/06 Dear John, After 27 years of selling Real Estate I finally completed and passed the broker exam! I tried studying the broker material through other well known schools several times before but gave up because the courses were SO boring. The Lumbleau class was interesting, I was able to stay awake and I passed the broker exam easily on the first try despite my history of test anxiety. I truly believe anyone can pass this test if they follow the Lumbleau program. Thank you so much for helping me complete my goal of 27 years!
Sandi Ohms


Dear Mr. Lumbleau: I just wanted to let you know that I passed the California Real Estate Broker's Examination on the first attempt on January 11, 2006 in San Diego. I really enjoyed the videotapes, and your very positive approach to everything. Thank you very much!! Very Sincerely,
Gregory Scafidi


I just wanted to let you know that I took my Broker test on January 4th, 2006 and passed on the first try. Thanks to your course study and exam preperation study materiel I was well prepared to take the test. Thanks again and Happy New Year!
Michael Fahim


Mr. Lumbleau, Thank you so much for helping me pass my Broker examination on the 1st try. With your help it was very easy! I was the 1st to finish in the first half and 4th in the second. I know it doesn't matter on the speed of finishing the test, but it just goes to show you how well the material is prepared for us students to study, and pass the test. I look forward to listening to the additional dvds to become a better Real Estate Agent. Sincerely, Randy Tripp
Randy Tripp


I wanted to give you the good news and tell you that I passed my brokers exam on 12-14-2005. You were right I was more than ready. The questions really prepared me for the exam. I studied for over a month and towards the end put in 6 to 9 hour study days. The sacrifice was worth it. I was currently an active realtor with a very busy scheldule and life but I made time to accomplish my goal, and that was to pass my brokers exam in the year 2005. Thank you so much for such wonderful study material and for answering your phone and help build my confidence. I will refer your material to everyone. Thanks again Mr. Lumbleau. Sincerely, Your student
Evelyn Hernandez


John, I just logged on to the California Department of Real Estate website to see my Broker exam results from December 8, 2005 and... I PASSED! WOO HOO! I attribute much of my success to your fine program. If you ever need a student testimonial, I am more than happy to recommend the Lumbleau curriculum with glowing praise. Thank you so much for providing me with such a valuable tool for success.
TJ Rossi


I just wanted to drop you a line, that I passed my broker exam thanks to your great prep course. Having taken another prep course and having failed the exam on a prior occasion, I wasn't sure I would make it because I didn't have enough time to finish your entire course, but with your method, I had enough info to get through a tough exam. Thank you again.
Alan Jablonski, Esq.


Mr. Lumbleau, I just found out I passed my broker exam! I could count on my fingers the number of questions I missed. I owe it all to your study material. Thank you,
Caleb Khan


Mr. Lumbleau, today I submitted to the DRE my completed Application for a Real Estate Broker's License ... because I passed the 11/23/05 Broker's Exam!!! I wanted to thank you for getting me through the quick path to licensing. You can count on me recommending your course to anyone who wants to not only pass ... but pass with confidence. 
Reggie Escalante


John,I am back to tell you thank you again! I just took my Broker’s exam and passed on the first try. I was the second person to finish in the morning session, 45 minutes, and the first person to finish in the afternoon session, 55 minutes. I felt absolutely confident during the exam that I knew the material and had studied that information that was critical to passing the exam. I can’t thank you enough and have passed on your information to a number of friends and associates that are interested in obtaining their licenses. I would recommend no other course than yours. If anyone would every like a personal referral, please have them contact me via my website at www.sidkirkland.com. Sid Kirkland
Sid Kirkland


Hey John, just wanted to let you know i passed my brokers exam on November 19. Your material made it easy and stress free the whole way through. All of the in depth questions, tests and up to the minute questions realy helped out tremendously. Thanks again 
Marc Sherman


Dear Mr. Lumbleau: I enrolled in your Broker review course in 1985 and passed the exam then but allowed my license to expire. With much confidence your system, I enrolled again in your Broker review course and passed the Broker exam again. I cannot come up with a better testimonial. Thank you for your help. 
Herminio V. Saysay


Just wanted to let you know that I purchased your course about 21 days before my CA Broker's Exam. I wasn't sure if the course could help me so close to my exam date. I knew that I needed the extra help because of the difficulty of the exam, so I purchased it anyways. It was absolutely amazing as to how accurate and how closely related the exam questions are to your course outline! When I left the testing area, I knew that I passed the test! I just received my results and as I thought, I passed! To anyone that is thinking they don't have enough time to study or is leary of purchasing an online test prep course, this is the one without a doubt! Just follow the instructions and take the practice exams and you will pass the test! Just wanted to drop you a note to say thanks! I really appreciate the course and the efforts that you have put into this course to make it exactly what you say it is!!! Thanks again,
Chad Martinez


I passed my broker's exam taken on 11/19/05. Many thanks! Your review questions, practice exams and tips were truly very helpful. I would highly recommend anyone who would want to pass the broker's exam to try your review course first!
Greg Uy


Thank you for your help in preparing for the Broker's exam. I passed it on the first try and rather easily. I Thanks again,
Eric Day


Hello John, I just wanted to give you some feedback regarding your Broker Exam Prep course. I took the Broker Exam on 11/16/05. I found out today that I passed (11/23/05) yea! In taking the Broker Exam, the DRE allows 2 1/2 hours in the morning session and 2 1/2 hours in the afternoon session. Because of your course, I finished the morning session in 58 minutes and the afternoon session in 43 minutes (I was the first one done for both sessions). There were only 3 (yes three) questions on the exam that were not covered in your prep work. Thanks for making this a positive experience. -
Kurt Anderson


I just got the results of my Broker Exam from the state of California and I want to thank you...I passed the first time. The review courses and question-answer format you have devised made the time I spent studying very effective and productive. I would heartily recommend your school to anyone preparing to take the Broker Exam!!!! Thank you again.
Timothy Porter


Hi Guys, just wanted to let you know that I passed my broker exam after I took your course. Your course really help me understand the questions. I was surprised of how many of the 200 questions in the exam have actually been explained throughout the course. Thanks for the course and the help. I certainly will recommend your school to everyone I know Sincerely yours,
Joe Maak


Hi John, Thanks for your help last week. I just wanted to thank you and let you know that I did pass the broker's exam. Your review was very helpful as many of the questions were the same as those on my test. Thanks again! I highly recommend your review and will refer others to you! 
Lon Mapes


I past my Broker Exam on 11/02/05. Eventhough they don't post the score, I must have had a near 90% on the exam. This was my first try and I did not even have a salesperon license. Your course had well prepared me for the state exam. 9 out of 10 question was almost exactly like the practice exam and course questions. I look forward to a great carrier in Real Estate and learning more from you in this great journey. Thank you 
Kam Aryavand


Dear Mr. Lumbleau, I am so delighted to have finally passed my RE Brokers exam. I had take the exam twice scoring a 71% and then a 73% following courses taken through the XXX Program. After much disappointment, I decided to try the Lumbleau Real Estate School. The on line questions covered all of the necessary areas and gave such thorough explanations for the answers. Thanks to Lumbleau, I passed my RE Brokers exam after two weeks of pressing through the on-line material. Thank you!!
Melanie Fussell


John, thank you so much. I passed my broker's exam. I finished the a. m. session about an hour earlier than the scheduled time and same thing with the p. m. session about an hour early too. I was so confident taking this test. your lessons and study material excel to anybody out there. What else can I say but THANK YOU and THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 
Percy Traballo


Lumbleau RE School, I just wanted to say thanks. I took the test last week and I just opened the mail and, guess what, I passed! I have to admit, I probably wasn't the best Lumbleau student ( Don't tell anyone that I only got through half the material!) but I still passed! Again, thank you.
Steven Lopez


Dear Lumbleau Schools; I just wanted to say "thank you" as I recently passed my Brokers exam. I had previously studied through another educational provider and quickly found that I was unprepared when I took the exam the first time. I learned of your exam prep courses, signed up and passed! Thank you,
Susie Christian


Just want to say thanks..I studied your exam preperation course and passed my brokers exam the first time..thanks again
JC


Mr Lumbleau, Yesterday I received the news that I have passed my broker examination. Your study materials were pivotal in me passing this test. I want to thank you and recommend to anybody who is serious about getting into Real Estate this course. Thank you again,
Mario Campos


John, What a phenomenal course!!!! I must say that I am probably one of the worst test takers in the history of taking tests.After going through the entire course, every DVD and test, I could not have been more prepared. I walked into that classroom confident and I walked out very sure that I would be getting a passing grade. I have never been so prepared for a test in my life. I have already referred 3 collegues to your school and assured them that the Lumbleau School is for real. Thank you John for making a product that actually does what it says its gonna do. You are the best teacher I have ever had. Thanks again John.
Dusty Lofrano


Dear Mr. Lumbleau: I took the Broker's Exam on October 12, 2005 and checked DRE’s website two days later and found out: I had passed! I am probably one of the lucky, prepared bunch who passed the first time! There are not enough words to say, "Thank you." So, Muchos gracias, Merci and Thanks a lot! Your course was well worth the $89. I had purchased another course from another real estate school, but I didn't want to be among the 73+% of those who did not pass. Your course gave me an edge. I felt your interactive course over-prepared me with its hundreds of question sets and I feel the two updates I received shortly before my exam date really sealed the deal. They were dead-on. Thanks to you, passing this exam the FIRST time will give me the opportunity to venture on my own, have more control in my real estate business, provide me the respect, responsibility, flexibility, challenges, and rewards which are unavailable to the Salesperson. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Broker in Los Angeles, California. (signed)
Rae Belisle


I thought you'd like to know that I passed my Broker's exam on the first attempt, this last Wed., 10/12/05. I really enjoyed the method of study on the internet - that was all I used. Thanks a lot for providing such an effecient way to study. Brenda Ball
Brenda Ball


Hi John, I just wanted to thank you for the material provided to me. I did pass my broker state exam. Also wanted to let you know, you will get referrals from me. Thanks Again, NOW - Real Estate Broker and Loan Officer
Henry Nazaryan


John: I took my Brokers exam 10-04-05 and couldnt write the answers down fast enough. I thought I was filling out one of your practice exams. I was amazed at the ease of it all. I am glad I found you. You were the edge that I needed to guarantee that I pass this course. I was the first to finish. You have earned all my business and referrals. Nice working with professionals. Very well done! P.S. If you charged triple for your services, I would consider it true value and money well spent.
Rich Naggar


I wanted John to know that I took the Calif real estate broker's exam Sept 2l and just learned that I passed. Your materials helped, particularly the guided lessons and the exams Very good guys and many thanks. A material portion of everything you have in your materials was helpful to passing the broker exam, and that is no small thing. Many thanks --
Ron Sokol


Hi, Just some jubilant feedback on the passing the brokers test on initial attempt. I had my Calif sales license 30 years ago was in the business for 2 years and took 10 college credit courses at that time. Some 28 years later I took your course and crammed for 2 weeks. I have the brokers license and am off and running. Good job on your part.Thanks 
John Bradford


Hello Mr. John Lumbleau, How are you? I just want to share the good news with you. Today I received my results of my broker exam and I finally pass my broker exam. Thank you for your program and your support. Advise when I am supposed to take the continuation broker courses. Thanks again I am a happy woman.
Yolanda Michaus


Thank you for your help and your course. I passed the exam on 8/26/05. Your course was invaluabe. 
Tonette Mahan-Dease


This morning on 9/20/05 the dre website read "Congratulations!" You passed the Broker exam!. All I could do was was shout YAHOOOO!!! Thanks Mr Lumbleau!
Darryl Thompson


Thank you for your excellent course. Like many of your students, I passed the exam on the first attempt. I am an attorney with no practical experience in the field, so I very much appreciated the comprehensive course you offered. The materials are truly all the diligent student needs to pass the exam.
Robert Tessier


Hey ! I just wanted to say that I took your $89.00 course and passed the Brokers Exam on my first try !! You guys are great! Thanks a bunch!
Monet Castaneda


Your study materials were exactly what I needed to make sense out of the broker exam material. I passed on the first try. I will of course recommend your system every chance I get. Thanks.
Connie Schroller


Hi John, I'd just like to let you know that I took the CA DRE Broker Exam on 8/12/05 and passed on my first try! Thanks for providing me with such a great program. I left the exam room with confidence that I had nailed about 80% of the questions and were able to narrow down the rest to two of the answers. The money I paid for your program was well spent. I saved both time and money by passing on the first attempt. Your program was direct and to the point, and I only learned what was essential for passing the state exam. Thanks again,
Joe Nguyen


Dear John, I passed!! Took the Broker's Exam on Monday 8/15 and found out today, Tuesday the 16th, that I passed. Thank you for your materials, advice, and encouragement. Tell your students if they study the questions, score an 85% or higher on practice exams, review tagged items, and not forget to review your update questions each day they too will pass. Was confident throughout and only saw 10 questions that I was a little uncomfortable with. Thanks again
John Roche


Etta: Thanks After three attempts, I passed the broker's exam. Your system works. Lumbleau: I cannot believe it. Three attempts at our school? Etta: No. This is my first attempt with your school and I passed. 
Etta Samuel


Mr. Lumbleau, I just wanted to take this opportunity to thank you for your course. I tested last Friday and I just got word that I passed my exam. I couldn't have done it without you and your course! The way in which you break down the test into easily understandable educational subsections makes it a much more effective learning tool than competing courses I've tried. I was one of the first to finish both portions of my exam because I had seen so many of the questions and ones similar to them during your practice exams and guided study. After I completed the first portion of my exam so quickly, a handful of people came up to me and asked me who I had used. I told them your name! They had used the same school as I had previously, and I simply told them I felt sorry for them. They said things like, "I don't feel prepared at all. I don't have a grasp of the concepts." While I was able to say with confidence that I KNEW WHAT I NEEDED TO KNOW! Having been in their shoes before, I can tell you that it feels a WHOLE LOT BETTER being in the "knowing what you need to know" position! You have the heart of a teacher and it shows! It's because of you and your course that I knew the material so well and was able to successfully complete the exam. I thank you once again for your extremely effective course and your skills as a teacher! Sincerely,
Dave Strachan


Hi John: Gladly, I like to inform you that I did pass the exam!!! This is due to your course and the way that it has been designed to help student step by step.. DVD & book program..and also available very courteous & helpful assisstance on the phone at your office hours... I did try many other schools that they claimed they are helpful... and I took their courses but every time I failed to pass the exam. I am glad that I took your course and passed..There is a proverb saying "Always merchandise speaks for itself" and its truly true about your course. I join with general voice in wishing your organization all the honour and happiness your known virteus and merit deserve, and am with perfect respect. Amen Rowhani

Mr. Lumbleau -I signed up for your course *way* last minute. 4 or 5 days before my exam date. When I called to get some info and you actually answered the phone. I found that refreshingly genuine. you told me exactly what I should do - blow off the videos and plow directly into the questions and bang out as many as I could do. In 4 days I made it through almost 1900 out of 2600 questions. I was the second one finished with the AM section. I nailed my 100 questions in about 1 hour. I jumped into the PM section, which had a bit more math, but it was pretty much brain-dead easy. I was about 5th done in the PM section out of a 150 or more. I thought, hmm, well, it FELT easy. Yes, I was right, I passed. Your online questions really nailed a very high percentage of questions on the exam. I will highly recommend your program to anyone who asks. Thanks for a great study program. Keep up the great work.
Rama Polefka


Just a note to let you know that I killed the broker's exam on my first attempt. I walked in to the exam nervous that I had only used one source (your exam prep questions), because in the days leading up to the exam I had browsed exam prep kits from other schools and found that they used words I had never heard in your course, and asked questions I had never studied. I walked out of the first section in about 35 minutes, and was told by the proctor that I set a new time record for section 1! Section 2 went just as smoothly, and I felt very confident the whole time. Many of the questions were DIRECTLY from your materials. Lumbleau is the best, and I will be back for continuing education in four years!
K.F


Recently completed your internet course... 3000+ questions, etc. It worked: I received notice yesterday... just over 24 hours after turning in my answer sheet that I passed the broker exam. I had also taken the salesperson exam a couple of days before; passed that too. Thank you.
Cal Jones


Thank you for your excellent program. I passed my broker exam on 7-28-05!!!!!!!!!!!! I owe it all to you.
Don Valenciano


John, I want to sincerely thank you for the role you played in me passing my exam.The Video Classes increased my performance tremendously.I enjoyed the classes so much that I was still watching the video last night even though I did get the results that I had passed.
Sarah A. Ahmed


John, I passed the brokers exam on July 19th on my 1st try! Your DVD instruction and practice exams gave a basic understanding of the questions and answers. Although I felt uncertain as I began, I was not suprised by my result. You said to believe in oneself and have the confidence to succeed.. Having been a seasoned investor ,I 'm on my way to help others find their investment dreams!!! Thank you...
Joe Fernando


Thank you for your help. I just passed the Broker Exam and it felt very comfortable after taking your licensing course for only $89.00 plus the cost of the book. I know you can take the exam more than once if need be, but I was thrilled to only have to take it once!! Thank you again. Regards,
LeiLani Miller


John: it took me two tries but I finally found you and passed this freekin broker exam. I wanna thank you and your program for making the difference. I spent the three days before the test in what I dubbed LumbCramBleau and it worked. Thanks again.
Brian Loring


John, thank you for a great exam prep! Im a member of the California state bar and a practicing attorney. I originally approached the brokers exam a “little cocky”! Wrong move! I looked at other material from other schools but it didnt compare to your prep book or prep questions. With your material you not only get the answer correct but you know why you did! Your questions were representative of what was tested and how it was tested. Obviously I passed. Thanks John!
Bill Murphy


I passed my broker test on my second try. If I had used the Lumbleau courses originally, I know would have passed the FIRST time! 
Nancy E. French


John Lumbleau you did it AGAIN !!!!!! You taught me so well I passed the California BROKER exam the first time! Thanks so much and God bless you and yours!
Jack Easum


I am a licensed California attorney. I recently took the Broker's exam after having studied from your on-line course. I passed the exam. Your questions were excellent. As I was uncomfortable relying on just your review course, I also enrolled in (name on request) Schools course. To say the least, your course was much better --- your questions were more consistent with the type of questions found on the exam. You are absolutely right --- scoring 85% on your practice exams will provide great security in knowing that you will likely pass the Broker's exam. Thank you very much for all your assistance.
Daniel Bornstein


Hi John, Thanks for providing a great course. You encouraged me to study at least four hours a day and I did around five or six and passed the exam on my first try. I studied only three and a half weeks hard core (yes, kinda crazy, but I just finished college so I easily get into a study zone) and I am so happy I don’t have to deal with the exam again. I got your flyer in the mail along with stuff from ten other companies, did the research, and went with yours. I will recommend your program to my friends. Thank you. 
Raziel Ungar


Dr. Edward Scott CPA Thank you so much for helping me with those questions. In the past, I've searched for the online courses that could help me to pass the Brokers exam. I've tried many other courses availlable out there. However, I was not able to find the one that could support me with accurate information until I found you.

John: I refer everyone I know to your on-line course. I got my first licence in 1970 at your school in Los Angeles. I let it expire in 1994. Your prospective students need to know to retake the broker exam I went to (Four schools mentioned - Names on request) and still failed the exam, having had to waste severa weekends and having to read 1000's of questions over and over again. But your on-line course prepared me for the broker's exam which I completed in the AM and PM sessions in less than 45 minutes, with both of them. I knew a minimum of 95% of the answers because taking your on-line course. 
Joseph Todd


I just passed the Real Estate Broker Exam, thanks to your Broker Exam Prep Only study aid. I was really worried about passing. However, nearly all the exam questions came from your study aid, and it was really easy to pass! -Not to mention the value of confidence you gave me once I entered the testing site (being able to recognize most of the questions totally took away my usual exam stress). Thank you, thank you, thank you!! 
Kate Morland


I passed the 6/13/2005 brokers exam on the first attempt! Yes! I spent a lot of time over the past two months going through the thousands of practice questions, and when I drove down for the test, I was confident and I knew I was prepared. This on-line approach works very well, and I recommend it highly. Thanks for the help. I'll be back in four years for the continuing education course.
James Hunter Ross


Hi John, > Thank you.. I passed my broker's examination! > I was confident after taking the examination that I passed! > Out of the 200 questions on my exam, there were only 45 questions that were not directly addressed by your course!! > Thank you again. 
Joseph Hilou


I took the test on June 9th it was a hard test but your course prepared me to pass. I reccomend Lumbleau over other places like (other schools) in the future I will tell my friends to take your course! Once again thank you 
Kevin Yu


Mr. Lumbleau, Just confirmed on the DRE eLicense system that I passed the Broker exam (first time) taken last week. Your program was the key to this success. I'm not in the industry; so much of the material was Greek to me. At least 75% of the test was contained in your Updates A & B, very few math questions. This is THE BEST way to learn to pass the exam! 
Clarence LaNier


Just wanted to thank you for your program. I passed the brokers's test. 
Mia Kim.


Dear Mr. Lumbleau, I had to write and THANK YOU for providing the BEST BROKER course! Out of the 3 schools I purchased videos, exam cram courses, tapes, flash cards, etc. YOUR ONLINE BROKER course was the best! I THANK YOU SO MUCH!! 
EILEEN HERMAN


Dear Mr. Lumbleau. I just wanted you to know that I passed the broker's exam on the first attempt. I particularly liked the format of your materials which enabled me to quickly review the questions I missed. During the final study period, that is all I did. I also appreciated the many positive affirmations of a successful exam outcome that you included in your lectures. I think by the time I finished the review, my mind was convinced that I would succeed, and I did. Best regards,
Bruce H. Whiting, esq.


Dear Mr. Lumbleau: I just found out that I pass the broker exam! Yeah…. The first day I signed up with you, you told me I will pass and not to worry. I thought you are a little too confident about me passing the test! But, you were right. I am very proud to say that I started the Real Estate business with Lumbleau and after 18 years, you are still around and I could get my broker license with your guidance and training. Thank you for helping me to succeed! Best Regards,
Akee Pritchard


Thanks for the great course. Passed the broker test. Top five to finish the exam on both sessions. Thanks again. Keep up the good work...... 
Robert


Dear Mr. Lumbleau, I just wanted to send you a thank you note for your school. I successfully passed the California Broker exam on May 5, 2005. The test was very hard but I am sure if someone studies your materials they will pass. Thank you again for your great course. Sincerely Yours,
Joseph Radin


Mr. Lumbleau, I am pleased to inform you that I have passed my test! After trying three times with an alternate prep course I was at my wits end. I only did the tests and some lessons and was the first one done on both sections. You are the man and have my uptmost thanks! If you are ever in Huntington Beach the fish tacos are on me. Thanks Again 
Trent Byer


I would like to thank you for your very complete and professional California broker exam preparation coarse. Between watching the DVDs and taking the online tests after each training gave me the confidence to take the state test and know that I passed immediately. I highly recommend your coarse to everyone that is scheduled to take their test if they want to pass the first time. Your recommendations, advice and enthusiasm that is given on the DVDs as well as the test guestions is what I found to be most helpful in keeping my motivation at peak. Again, thank you for assisting me in passing my real estate brokers state test. 
Richard Noah


Dear Mr. Lumbleau, Just wanted to let you know that I passed the broker's exam! Since I live far away from weekend "crash preparation" course sites, your course gave me the opportunity to study thoroughly without having to leave my home. Thank you! Thank you! Sincerely,
Barbara Wall


I passed my Brokers exam this last friday. It was the 2nd time that I had taken the test. If I would have followed your instructions during my original studies, I would have passed the first time through. Thank you for your course.Sincerely,

Mr. Lumbleau; I just found out that I passed my Broker exam! Thanks to you and your wonderful program. 
Ron Delon


I bought the Lumbleau Real Estate School Broker License course on March 19, 2005. I studied for one month, I took my Broker Real Estate exam on April 18, 2005, and I PASSED! I got the good news on April 21, 2005, by checking the DRE website for my exam result. This was the best $89 I ever invetsed. Thank you Lumbleau Real Estate School.
Siyavash Araumi


To the folks at Lumbleau - Just passed my Broker's exam after studying with Lumbleau online program for the past couple of months. After sampling other programs, Lumbleau really pulled me through and is much more in touch with the material and the test itself than any of the others, or all of the others combined. I will now only reccomend Lumbleau to colleagues..will save them a great deal of time, and it is absolutley worth the effort. Just wanted to say thanks!! Kind regards, Emily
Emily McGranaghan


Just a quick note to let you know that I passed my Brokers exam, and to Thank You, for your course and your excellent customer service. I tried two other exam preparation courses from other real estate schools and after 15 years as a Salesperson, I still failed the Brokers exam. I took your course, and passed on the first try. Thank You, Thank You, Thank You! You'll be the only real estate school, I'll recommend when people ask me about schools.
Sylvia Young

I wanted to let you know that I passed the broker exam on the first attempt. I would like to thank you for a great course of instruction. Even though it took a while to complete your 3200 questions, it was well worth it! Thanks again. Sincerly, Mark D. Flanagan
Mark D. Flanagan


I think I was the 9th to finish the test on Monday 4-4-05 after about an hour. Were we all Lumbleau students? It was certainly a full room that was left in the exam room. And according to the note I found under E-Licensing, I passed the exam. I think there were maybe 3 or 4 questions out of the 200 that had not been brought to my attention (could be my fault) so your material does cover the bases. Thank you.
Darlene Wills


I just found out that I passed my broker's exam. This was my first try and your lessons were instrumental in helping me study for the test. Thanks alot. 
Jason Farhadi


Dear Lumbleau School: I passed, on my first attempt! Thanks again for your outstanding preparatory course and material -- I couldn't have done it without you! 
Matt Boxberger


Thank you all," I passed the test", what ever you do keep on doing it. Thanks again from a satisfied client. 
Efren M Guttierrez


Congratulations!. You now have another agent turned broker due to your services. I passed the lesson guides without taking the practice exams. That was enough to get me to pass the state bokers exam. Thank-you,
Daniel H. Gressamann


John, I passed broker test. Wanted to let you know your course software was the reason. Thanks. Kathy Keathley
Kathy Keathley


I passed my broker's test on my first try--thanks again to your system. > Couldn't have been easier. Thanks,
Johnathan S.


John, Thank you! I am happy to report that your preparation courses worked! On March 2nd I took the broker's exam and one week thereafter I received the most desired response in the mail, "Congratulations you have passed." Thanks again!
Jeff McNutt


Hi John, Thanks for getting me a pass the first time on the broker exam that I took 3/1/05. I didn't get through all of the material in the Broker Exam Prep course, but I did take and review all of the practice exams, and most importantly, the "exam updates". In the morning session I was the first one done out of 90 people, and that was going through the exam twice. You course is perfectly designed to accomplish what is necessary- PASS THE EXAM! Thanks, and I will be sending everybody I can your way. Sincerely, Chuck
Chuck Drake


Hi John, Here's another success story for you: I didn't even finish going through all of the study material, but I passed the exam on the first try on 2/23/05. I only got serious about studying about three weeks before, but the way your material is set up helped me retain everything quickly. Also, it didn't hurt that many of the questions on the exam were the same as the ones in our practice exams. Thanks for helping me get my Broker's license!
Laura Doyle


I passed the broker exam on the first try thanks to your great course!
George Bustamante


Passed on my 1st try! I took your broker crash course. I followed your instructions exactly. I passed. The only thing more I can say is Thank you, Sincerly, Andy Brown (soon to be) Broker Associate, Julie Brown & Associates
Andy Brown


Mr Lumbleau, Thank you for your lessons, not just on real estate but about success. After researching the internet on studies out there, I took a leap of faith and went with you. I am glad that I did. My exam was set for the 26th of Jan. So, I had three weeks to the examination. I had 14 DVDs to watch (which I did) and I also had scores of practise exams to take on computer. I checked on my results yestarday and discovered that I passed. I am so greatful to my teacher and mentor (Mr. Lumbleau). He was there for me and I so happy that I did not disappoint him.
Damian Okojie


I am writing to let you know that I passed the Cal broker exam on 5th of January. Thanks Lumbleau!
Chris Catbagan


I loved the courses. I ordered the broker courses online. I was able to read the books and took the online tests when I was in Florida. Lambleau's testbooks are very on the target, especially the Real Estate Principal course. The exercising questions are very important, make sure you take those questions before you go to the broker test. I would say 85% questions that I encountered on the real test are in their collections. Their phone support is very good. I am very happy with them overall.
Yan Zhanz


Dear Mr. Lumbleau,
I just wanted to send you a thank you for your school. I successfully passed the California Broker exam on Dec. 22, 2004. Thank you again for your instruction and video school.

Dear Mr. Lumbleau:
I recently found out that I passed the Broker's exam. Just wanted to thank you for the excellent course.
Scott Johnson


Dear John,
Just a note to tell you that my only preparation for the broker exam was your prep course and I passed on my first attempt! I am happy to refer you to everyone interested in taking either the agent or broker's exam.
Thank you very much.
Rory DeMeire


John,
Thank you for the excellent preparation for the California Real Estate Broker exam. I passed the Broker exam on the first attempt. I particularly enjoyed the split screen effect where the rationale behind the question was explained. This saves time finding the information in the textbook.

I think you are on the right track in providing a format for learning that is effective, focused, and efficient.
Best regards,
Bob McLaughlin


Just passed the brokers exam. Thanks for everything. Could not have done it without you.
Jason Rodin


I am a Chiropractor and I knew very little about real estate business. When I took my first broker exam, I was lost and my score were low. After taking the Lumbleau programs and followed his instructions to the best of my ability, I am happy for not only I passed the broker exam on my first attempt with your course but I really learned more in your classes than any other programs that I tried before. From now on Lumbleau courses will be my guide for better success and I Thank You Mr. Lumbleau for sharing your experience that some you’ve learned from your own father which to me are the key for better life.
God Bless and thank you
Dr. Jemiss Nazar, D.C.,J.D.


Great software! I passed the Broker's Exam on 11/24/04 on my first try! During the lunch break, I was studying on my laptop, where I had downloaded your software. I spoke to several people who were "lost" after the 1st session. Many people came up and asked, "You seemed to finish soon"--- I was the 2nd person to finish both portions of the exam. I said, "Yes, and I know I passed." Some of the people, that I'm sure were part of the 80% who flunked on the first try, said, "Yeah, I saw his course but decided NOT to buy it." I told them your course saved me so much time, John! Thanks, for your course and work behind the scenes. All my future loan officers in CA WILL come to you!
Thanks!
Jeff Gruhler


Thanks to you and your magical tapes and long exams, I passed the Borker's exam. I will be calling you soon, I have new things to tell you. Congratulations! YOU DID IT AGAIN!!
Elziabeth Jibilian


Dear John
Just wanted to let you know that I passed the Brokers Exam on November 15, 2004. Your preparation course worked perfectly for me, and several of the questions on the update test were on the test I took. So thank you very much for such a great preparation for taking the Exam and being able to pass it at the first attempt. I'm thrilled!
Sincerely,
Mary Kirby


I just passed my Broker test on the first try. I know it was due to your software. I had some other materials, but if I hadn't gotten your software I would not have passed. I'm sure of that.
Thank You
Paul Adams


Thank you very much for your program. I credit your program with allowing me to pass my broker exam on the first try.

I had a limited amount of time to study - certainly no time to spend a whole weekend at some crash course. Your program was EXACTLY what I needed. I loaded it on my laptop and took it with me wherever I went. I like the way the program moved from topic to topic, tallying results and allowing for "unsure" responses. It was quick, efficient, and facts were more prone to stick in my memory.

But I especially liked your practice exams. They really prepared me for the actual format and questions on the real exam.

The "cherry on the top" in your program was the most up-to-date exam that I was able to download just a few days before my test. This test had several questions that were virtually exact to those asked on the exam. I believe it made the difference between pass and fail for me.

Thank you again for all the work you put into an excellent program. I was able to write my broker exam calmly and with assurance. Never have I felt so stress-free at an examination. Your program prepared me well in every way.
Thelma Saunders


Dear Mr. Lumbleau,
I took the Broker Exam on November 10, and checking the results with the DRE, the words "congragulations..." was more than a music to my ears. I want to thank for all the support and materials that was available to me. The study materials were designed in a way that it prepared me, from different angles, which made all the difference on passing the exam on the first attempt.
Sincerely,
May Emirzian


Dear Mr. Lumbleau:
I can't thank you enough for the wonderful, in-depth materials that were provided to me as part of the California Real Estate Broker's Exam course. I simply dedicated myself to following your easy-to-use instructions and recommended study format. I set time aside every day to study. I found that, on the day of the exam, I was confident and prepared instead of nervous and unsure. Many of the other exam participants who were in line to get their test were complaining that they'd already taken it 4 or even 5 times without success!

Thanks to your course and materials, there was no question on the exam that threw me and I passed easily the 1st time. Through the additional use your DVD course, I felt like you were really there in person, one-on-one encouraging me. I will be happy to recommend your courses to anyone. 
Thanks again!!
Sarah Miller-Legg


Hey John.
I passed the Brokers exam on 10/14/04. Thanks for the material. You are still the best in the game.
Cameron Turner


John,
I wanted to send you a testimonial. I ordered your broker course and followed it just as you suggested. I took my brokers test for the first time on 10/27/2004. I found out on Friday 10/29 that I PASSED!! I wanted to thank you for preparing me. The test was a breeze thanks to your prep material. The course and questions had me ready and I would like to tell everyone who is thinking of taking this test to order your material. It is unlike any other.
Thanks!!!
Will Younghans


John,
I passed the Broker Exam! Just wanted to let you know that your prep materials were great!
Thanks.
Milan Patel


Just to let you know I passed my Brokers exam the first time and with no problems.
Bob Barrie


Just passed my brokers test! This course is by far the only way to pass the test. I used xxxxx Real Estate school materials which covered just the basics and failed two times. With Lumbleau, you had the majority of the questions that were very similiar if not the same. Thank you again!!!
Sam Smith


John:
Passed the CA broker's exam on the first try with your review course. Thank you for all the help. As they say, You're the Man!
Alan Coutris


Mr. Lumbleau,
I just took and passed my broker's test on September 29, 2004 thanks to your study course. I can honestly say that your material was very representative of the material on the test, unlike some of the other material from another company that I studied. Your material helped me think things through the problem questions on the test which pushed me over the top. Thanks again and I WILL definitely RECOMMEND your course to anyone who's going for the broker's test!
Howard Huie


Thanks for the help.
I passed the California Brokers exam on the first try. Many of the questions on the test seemed comfortably familiar after working through your lessons.
Stanley Scott


Dear Mr. Lumbleau,
I just wanted to thank you for your Broker Licensing course that I used to pass the state examination. I took the broker exam on Monday (9/13/04) in Los Angeles and have just been informed via the internet that I passed the exam!.
Thank you again.
Efren Rodriguez


Dear John,
I just wanted to let you know that I passed my broker exam on the first attempt. I took the entire five hour test in about 1 hour and 15 minutes, much to my surprise and delight. I had a great deal of outside stress going the morning of my test, a sudden death, the addition of a 12 year boy into my home and countless other problems. The only thing I can think that got me to pass was the great lesson plan that you provided. My other sister, Pat will be ordering her sales person course from you tomorrow.
Thanks again,
Sherilyn Chunestudey


Thank you very much!
I was so afraid that after 5 attemps to pass using other schools it would be the same again, but I bougth your course and passed on 9/3/2004. My problem was that I had cancer and the radiation left me with some problems of retaining the data, but I passed. Thank very much!
Luis Roldan


Hi John,
As I mentioned to you over the phone today, I passed the Broker's exam in the first attempt. I must say that your on-line study course was extremely useful. I did not have to read any other meterial. I liked the way the course is structured. Thanks for excellent on line course. I strongly reccommend this course for all prospective students.
Regards,
Narayan Sanbhadti


Dear Mr. Lumbleau,
I Wanted to let you know that I just found out that I passed the broker's exam on my first try. Your on-line course was an invaluable resource for me to study and pass the exam. Your exam questions are very similar to the ones you find on the exam, and your exam update 1 week before the exam couldn't have been more helpful! I would recommend your course to ANYONE. There is no reason why an intelligent person who really takes the time to study your program would ever fail!
Thank-you for your course, and wish me luck as I shift gears into my new career!
Nevil Dhabhar


Dear John:
Thank you for your support and for your effective program -- I just found-out that I passed the Broker's Exam (8/18) -- first try. Took some discipline on my part too, but I am now convinced that if a student works for 1-2 months a few hours a day, does the practice exams and studies his/her mistakes, this material with its great teacher is just what it takes to get you to pass.
Thank you again Mr. Lumbleau,
Robert Graf


Thank you John for your course, I passed the broker's exam on my first try.
Jim Park


Hi John,
Just wanted to tell you I PASSED THE BROKER EXAM!!!!
Thanks for your help & tech support - your guided and practice exam program really expanded my knowledge which helped me focus on results!
Thanks & regards,
Susan McKay


John,
I want to take a moment to thank you for helping me pass the broker's exam on my first try! I used materials from other schools in addition to the Lumbleau material and even took a 2-day live exam prep course through another school. However, your material stood out as the best, hands down! You are an excellent teacher, and your method truly works. I understood the concepts you taught rather than just memorizing certain questions or ideas, which I believe was pivotal in my passing the exam so easily. The latest exam questions I downloaded from your website a few days prior to taking the state exam were fantastic! I saw some of them word for word on my broker's test. Also, Thank you again for a wonderful product and for all of the help you gave me in passing the real estate broker's exam.
Cherie Miranda


Hello John,
When I read all your materials, the Guided Lessons, the Practice Exams, and the CA Exam Update, I was amazed how much I understood every single thing which I failed to understand when I took some classes and crash course at a different school. Your wordings, the language used, and the way things were presented were very logical and easy to understand. Only then did I finally realized that understanding the situation/case is more important than memorizing the answers. That way, you'll begin to empower yourself with considerable degree of comprehension with each and every scenario.

Simply stated, your materials brought an enormous amount of comprehension and recognition to the actual test. I can't express how much grateful I am for enrolling in your school, for which, I wouldn't make it to the Final Exam had I not read and study all your materials.

Besides, I admire and salute the kind of Customer Service you personally provided when I call your office just to verify and ask some questions. You are very patient and extremely helpful, with an Excellent Customer as well.

I made it, and finally passed the State Exam, so to speak. Here's some good wishes from the bottom of my heart: THANK YOU, JOHN, AND MORE POWER TO LUMBLEAU SCHOOL! I would not hesitate to recommend your school to anyone.
Best regards.
Lani Santiago


I passed my broker's exam with the help of your broker course. Your claim is justified 100%. Again thanks a lot. It was worth spending money for your course.
Thanks a million.
Azhar Ali


I just wanted to let you know that I passed first try. After going through the practice problems, the exam itself was a joke.
Tom Leibowitz


Hey Mr. Lumbleau,
I just wanted to let you know your material was the best, the videos were fun to watch and I've even repeated some of the stories you told to other real estate associates. I definitely recommend the videos and guided lessons. I passed my Brokers exam last week.
Thanks a lot
Daniel Brown


Dr Mr. Lumbleau:
I am so excited to announce to you that I have finally passed my broker's exam with many thanks to you and your very kind support. If you need any student testimony from me on behalf of your course, I would be more than happy to say it is your course that finally got me over this major hurdle. And trust me, I have tried many!
Again, thank you ever so much
Donald Westfall


Hi John,
I passed the Real Estate Broker's exam the first time. Your test material was a great help. I recommend your test and school materials to anyone that wants to pass the Real Estate exams. I bought the Real Estate Salesperson's material for my wife.
Doug Nash


Hi John,
Just a quick note to say THANK YOU!!
I fell flat on my face the first time I took my Brokers exam after preparing through a different company. I found your web site and signed up for the exam cram last month. I took my test Wednesday and just received notice that I passed!!!
Thanks again,
Lynda Eckols


John,
I just wanted to take a minute to thank you. I recently purchased your Broker review course after being very unhappy with other competitive products. I felt so unprepared after the other courses that I actually rescheduled my exam. My experience was that the other courses were no more than Salesperson reviews with some Broker exam questions throw in.

The method of study that you have developed is unlike any other that I have ever experienced. Your Broker review course is in my opinion the only one anyone will ever need. I completed the course over a six week period. However during the last week of my review I developed a very bad case of the flu that seriously cut down on my final review efforts.

I took the exam with a temperature of 102 and feeling absolutely awful. I was sure that I would be re-taking the exam again, but I passed!!! I am convinced that the Lumbleau method of study is the reason why.

I have recommended the Lumbleau course to several Sales as well as Broker candidates and I will continue to do so. Thanks so much for a fantastic program. I couldn't have done it without Lumbleau!
Steve Zimmerman


Hi John
Just wanted you to know that on the recommondation of my mother I took your broker course. I took the May 5th exam and passed! I found many of your materials on the exam verbatim. Thank God, and you that I don't have to sit through that again!
Silvia San Nicolas


John
I passed the Broker’s exam on my first try. I want to thank you for the course I downloaded from your website it was very very helpful and I am sure it contributed to me passing the exam on the first try. One of my friends is planning to sit the exam in the near future and I have advised him without reservation to purchase your course material. The program is very effective at imparting a lot of information in a very effective and efficient way and it helped me to cover the material much faster that if I was using the traditional book method. Keep up the innovation in this regard you provide a very valuable service.
Edmund Thornton


Hello John!
I just wanted to thank you for the kindly attention you gave me since I became your student. You see John, English is my second language and I struggled tremendously to understand the material until I began to "really" study your course... and guess what? I PASSED THE BROKER'S TEST!
Thank God for your help.
Thank you. Keep up the good work.
Sincerely,
Armando Valdez


Hello,
I purchased your Exam Passing Course a few weeks ago and am proud to say that I passed the California Broker Exam on my first try last Wednesday. The course was well designed and well written. I was able to highlight the text that was provided to produce a clear guide to the elements which were difficult for me. The practice sessions and practice exams were worded in such a way as to make them similar in style to the actual exam, and that was invaluable to my preparation. Thanks for allowing me to start a new career on a high note.
Sincerely
Richard James


Mr. Lumbleau I would like to personally thank you for helping me pass the state exam. I cannot begin to describe how effective and valuable your real estate course was in helping me pass the State exam THE FIRST TIME! I cannot imagine passing the State exam without enrolling in your course.
Erik Nazarian


Dear John,
I just want to thank you for having the best broker course in the real estate industry and no other real estate school can compare to what you teach in your course. I've tried other schools and their emphasis was on the sales exam not the broker exam. After taking your course. I'm please to report that, with your material, I passed the broker exam with no difficulty.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH!!!!!!!
Marquette Shurelds


I passed the state broker exam. It was the second exam for me. Your exam material was excellent and very helpful for me. I appreciate that.
Thank you very much.
jm


Dear Mr. Lumbleau, Thank you for being instrumental in my passing the brokers exam on the first try on March 4. When the California real estate commissioner boasted on the DRE website that the licensee exams had been revamped, I knew the key was to learn as much as possible about the new questions. The additional material you provided me a week before the test was very useful.
Thanks for your help.
Billie Truesdell


Hi John,
You are now officially one of those people I will never forget! I watched your CD's, studied your material and passed all your practice exams. I passed the Brokers test last week. I studied hard for three months and began with absolutely no background in Real Estate. Thanks again for a great course.
Tim Anderson


Dear John:
Today I learned that I passed the broker's exam. I am very grateful for your assistance. Without the most recent sample questions and proposed answers I would have been lost. I will forward you my opinion of the recent exam as soon as I complete it. I hope I will be able to help your other students as you have helped me. Again, thank you.
Sergio Diaz


I passed!
Your course helped me to focus on the "right stuff". Your guided lessons did the job!
Thanks!
Jim Wright


Dear Mr. Lumbleau
After struggling through a myriad of questions supplied through another "real estate school", and passing respectively on each chapter, I took my state exam only to fail it. I discovered later, after reviewing these questions, that many were outdated or just plain wrong.

That's when I remembered taking your exams for my salesperson license and passing on the first try! I ordered your broker's course and again studied the many questions, however the difference here was receiving a letter of congratulations from the state. I passed my broker's exam!
John Lumbleau, thank you for taking the time to update your courses.
With my gratitude
Sincerely
Diane Kessloff


Dear John:
I want to commend you and your staff for providing me with the ability to pass the California Real Estate Brokers Examination on the first attempt.

Your company provided excellent customer relation support and guidance when I had questions about the study materials or methods of study to be employed.

The exam passing software was right on the mark. Through continual repetition of the material and reinforcement of the correct answers, passing the test became a given. I am convinced that any reasonably intelligent, motivated person can pass the DRE examination through taking the Lumbleau Real Estate School courses.

Just wanted to thank you. I finally passed! Your course was the best study tool I could have invested in. I tried about 5 others, and none came close to what your company offers. The questions were almost exact to what is studied in your material. I felt very comfortable leaving the exam room.
Thanks Again!
Erskine Sankey


I took the Broker's exam yesterday after studying your exam passing course. About 80% of the questions were almost identical to the ones I studied. It was like the answers stood out from the page as if they were highlighted.

Hi John!!
I just wanted to thank you for your program. I did the $89.00 Broker Practice Exams, and I passed my exam the first time!!
I was so happy.
I took my test on 1/21/2004. Without your course I know I would not have passed. I was well prepared after taking your course only 2 weeks ahead of my test date. I was cramming, but it was well worht it!!
Thank You!

John,
Thanks for being patient and providing the necessary information to pass the brokers exam. I took my test on Wed and found out this morning I passed. I am so excited and relieved, especially on my first try.
Thanks again,
Coleen Reily


Quick note- As promised I went into broker exam, more relaxed than before and felt good afterwards. I passed! Thank you. You are such a great guy. I am now watching your "tips" dvd. The motivation you give during the material was good. Your material is very good. I will continue to tell all I know..
Thanks John- and Bless you for what you are doing.
Best Regards
Linda Smith


Dear John,
I enrolled in your Broker course in late October. I was a little skeptical about your course at first because you have this "pass the exam guarantee" that is similar to XXXX School. I failed the exam twice after taking XXXX's course, so I was very discouraged. I studied your course and did all 2800+ questions. I spent the last week reviewing the tougher questions. It took a total of 30 days of studying and I finally passed the exam. Thanks for putting such a great course together. A large number of questions found in your course actually appeared on the exam!

Dear Mr. Lumbleau:
I just wanted to let you know I passed my Broker's Exam on my first try, and that you truly have the most amazing preparation course available.
I am a Lawyer, and I can bet every law student can only wish to have Bar exam preparation courses designed just like yours.

I didn't think I was going to make it because State Exams are generally hard, but your practice exam questions were no different than what was in the exam.

If anyone is thinking about obtaining a real estate license, they need to see you first.
Thank you very much for contributing back to the industry by sharing your knowledge. Your help is priceless.

John,

John,
I passed the Broker's Exam the first time November 24th.
Thanks for all your help. I can't wait to start my RE career.
Thanks and Best Regards,
Steve Yang


John,
I passed the Brokers Exam on Nov 24th, this time around, thanks!
Your review questions and practice exams were a huge help, I managed to finish going through all the study guide questions and practice exams by Sunday before my exam itself. I would say 15-20% of the questions were rather similar to the study guide questions. In general the exam was very comprehensive and encompassing a wide ranging subject matters.
Thank you,
Joo C Lee


Mr. Lumbleau,
Thank you for helping me to pass the California State Broker's Exam.
Your combination of video tapes, textbooks, and online materials allowed me to obtain a thorough foundation of real estate topics. After taking your course I now feel further inspired and equipped to succeed in the real estate field. I only hope that one day I am able to pass along such a vast wealth of knowledge to others, just as you have passed it on to me. You now have my recommendation to any who ask about obtaining a license, and if we ever meet face to face, a hearty handshake of gratitude from me.
Thank You,
Aaron Abdus-Shakoor II


Dear John:
I took the brokers test last Friday and learned today that I had past. I was formerly a broker who has let my license lapse long ago and I couldn’t have passed the test without your support. Your preparation formula worked!
Thanks very much,
Richard J. Cohn


John:
I am a real estate attorney who has practiced for 19 years. I just took my broker's exam for the first time and passed it (!) and simply would not have without your exam prep. The whole experience is awful, but your materials made the trouble worth the while.
Thanks

John,
Just needed to tell you that I passed the Broker test on Oct 15 in LA. Thank you! The courses were outstanding! Excellent Courses!
Bill Campbell


Dear John,
I'm so excited! I just read the following on the DRE website:
Congratulations! You Passed the Broker Exam taken on October 17, 2003. Your license application was printed for mailing on October 20, 2003.
If not for your course, I am sure I would not be writing to you today. The Broker Exam questions were either the same as the Practice Exams or very similar. I will highly recommend your course to others.
Thank you,
David Cook


Mr. Lumbleau,
I would like to thank you for a broker passing program that works.
These exams are very intimating and challenging, especially since I have never been in the profession. Your course gave me the confidence and enabled me to pass the broker exam. Your personal attention and patience guided me through the course. I am happy to say that I passed the exam and am ready to start my new career.
I would highly recommend this course to anyone who is considering going into the real-estate profession.
Sincerely,
Shawn Grover


Hello John,
I passed the Broker's exam (first attempt) with the help of your study material. Thanks for your help.
Derrick Evans


After studying the broker course at another on-line school and attempting the California broker exam twice, I passed after studying Lumbleau's broker course the very first time! The course is set-up similar to state bar study courses that are most beneficial to passing the very first time.

Good morning John!
You were right! I passed my brokers test! Thank you so much for your school program online. I want to buy the full package for your sales for my 2 sons, who want to pass the sales exam. They didn't pass with the local school - last month. Please send me the info. Thank you so much again. Especially for answering your phone everytime, you were always there to help.
Sincerely,
Maryann McConnell


Dear John,
Thank you for the guidance you provided me last week. Look what I read last night on the DRE web site...Congratulations! You Passed the Broker Exam taken on August 27, 2003. Your license application was printed for mailing on August 28, 2003.
Again, thank you for your trust in me with the information that you felt was sensitive.
Sincerely,
Gilbert George


John,
Just a quick note to let you know I passed the Broker's exam on Aug 13. I purchased your study guides less than a week before the exam. I know I would not have passed the exam without the intense studying I devoted myself to using your course. Thank you for your help in getting them e-mailed to me so quickly.
Victoria Rondeau


Hi John,
I like to thank you for your excellent broker exam material to help me successfully past the broker exam on July 30, 2003. I spent two months to watch the videos and your notes. I had about 15% questions that I did not know the exact answers, but I can guess them based on your material and commonsense.
Best Regards,
David Chern


Dear John,
I took the broker's exam yesterday and I am sure that I passed with flying colors. I found your course very helpful and might not have passed without it. Notwithstanding that I have worked in the real estate area over my entire legal career, it is a fact that many of the state questions are misleading, have answers that are of questionable validity, or deal with arcane areas that no responsible broker would opine on without consulting a solid reference. Your course clarified the answers to the vast majority of those questions.
Thank you for your help.
Michael S. Pecherer


Dear John;
I just wanted to take the opportunity to commend you and your course. I passed the July 2, 2003 broker examination after doing everything you professed so well.
Thanks for your support, professionalism, personal attention and your enthusiasm. It is greatly appreciated for certain.
Sincerely yours,
Rory W. Smith


I just wanted to let you know I passed the broker test on the first try last week. Thanks for your test-passing software. There were many, many questions that were on the State test that you had in the study materials. Good stuff!
Paul Bischoff


Dear Mr. Lumbleau,
I just wanted to drop you a line and let you know that I received the results of my California Real Estate Broker Exam, and I have passed. You were right. If you take your review course there is no question you will pass. Thanks again for all the help.
Yours very truly,
Mario F. Veltri


Thanks to your excellent course, I recenly passed the Broker's exam easily.
Thanks,
Jim Pirkle


Dear John:
I wanted to take just a few minutes to write you and complement you on a very thorough and extremely well organized computerized learning course for passing the CA State Broker exam. In addition, I want to personally thank you for your courtesy and expediency in addressing the questions I had the few times I contacted you. You were always available and very supportive with helping me through the process.

When I first called you regarding applying for, and taking, the Broker exam, you quickly and properly walked me through the six statutorily required college level real estate courses I would need to take to qualify for the Broker exam and the details of how your computerized program would prepare me for the exam. Your pricing was very reasonable (at the time - and now I consider it a BARGAIN). I signed up and received all of the necessary course material from you on June 8th.

I took the Real Estate Principles exam on June 27th (the earliest date on which I was qualified to take the exam), applied to the California DRE to take the Salesperson exam (for practice) while I continued to take the remaining five courses I needed to be able to apply for the Broker exam. I passed the Salesperson exam on August 16th and completed the last course needed to be able to apply for the Broker exam on September 20th.

I immediately applied to the State DRE to take the Broker exam and passed it, on the first attempt, on October 30th. That was just 145 days from the receipt of the materials from Lumbleau Real Estate Schools. You had projected, when we first spoke, that it would probably be mid-December before I could reasonably expect to complete the six required courses, your Broker exam learning course, and apply for and pass the Broker exam.

I attribute the speed of my completion and the success of passing both the Salesperson and Broker exams on my first attempt to the quality of your 14 stage learning program and subsequent final four trial exams. Your program not only made it easy to pass the Salesperson and Broker exam, but made it very easy to pass the six courses I needed to qualify for the Broker exam, as I was learning from your 14 stage program while waiting the required minimum 18 days between qualifying to take the exam for each of the six courses.

I have already been touting your program to those people I know who are considering getting either a Salesperson or a Broker license, and will continue to do so. I would be happy to be reference if you should ever need one. That's how good your program is. You are providing a very valuable service to those interested in the field of Real Estate. Thank you again.
Sincerely,
Malcolm McNeill


Thanks for your support.
I passed the Sales person and Broker exam first shot. The questions were very similar to those that were on my exams.
Thanks again.
Paul Bergeron


I just got my results on the California Broker's exam - I passed the first time. Your course was wonderful, I saw at least 80% of the practice questions on my exam. I will recommend your course highly to all my friends. Thank you for your hard work in putting together such a complete study guide.
MaryAnn M.


Dear Mr. Lumbleau: I first off want to inform you and your wonderful Real Estate school, that after years of dedicated study, I finally passed my Brokers exam. First I decided to study a program that a friend of mine had said was a sure fire way of passing the Brokers Exam. I spent several months working the material and in July of 2002 I sat for that 5 hour devil we all call the Brokers Exam. The results were not good. I did not pass. I was very upset because I had really spent the time and done all the work. I felt that I had failed because I wasn't doing something. That something was getting a better feel for what it was the questions were asking, how to read those questions and the best way to answer them. 

Then I remembered the Lumbleau schools technique from years ago. Learn to read the exact type of questions the state has for its exam. I went through your interactive broker exam passing software. My test date was September 4. I passed! It was your course of study that helped me learn to read the questions the way the state wanted them answered. Your methods are the best for the end results. I thank you for being the teacher that the real estate industry can trust and rely on. Over the 25 years that I have been a real estate licensee, I have always been able to turn to the Lumbleau Real Estate Schools for the training and education necessary to keep my license active. 

So today I must thank you again for developing the course of study I used to pass my Brokers Exam.

Sincerely,
Lynn T.
