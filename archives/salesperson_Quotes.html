"YOU GAVE US ENCOURAGEMENT AND MOTIVATION"
Hello Mr. Lumbleau my name is Angelica Corona, I purchased the Real Estate Sales Agent course from you, and I would like to let you know that I passed my Exam the first time I took it. My exam was on April 29, 2010. I want to say that I truly enjoyed the way you teach the course. I personally liked that at the beginning of every class you gave us encouragement and motivation. I thank you very much and I will let everyone who is interested in becoming a Real Estate Sales Agent or Broker to go to you. Thank you very much God Bless You
Angelica Corona


"YOUHAVE A GENUINE DESIRE TO SEE THAT EVERY PERSON PASSES"
Hello Mr. Lumbleau, I wanted to thank you for dedicating your life to sharing your knowledge and enthusiasm for the benifit of so many people. After purchasing your course I had a few questions on getting started and called your office on three different occasions and you personaly answered the phone. I was quite surprised and was caught off guard but knew I had just purchased the right course. You have a genuine desire to not only to see to it that every student passes the state exam, but to coach us all on the secrets of success. I enjoyed the tutorials before each lesson and the stories that went along with your invaluable advice on how to succeed. It`s hard enough for some to study, so keeping it interesting is a bonus. Thank-you for the free success videos. There are many success videos out there but few that relate to the field of real estate that as are comprehensive as your`s. I took the state exam and passed it the first time. I look forward to further my education through your systems. Thanks again,
Matt Doyle

"YOUR COURSE IS THOROUGH I ENJOYED TAKING IT"
Hi John, I wanted to let you know I took my test on September 1, passed the first time, my license has been issued and my new career is off to a successful start. I am already working with qualified buyers, and am marketing to sellers.Your course was thorough and I enjoyed taking it. I especially enjoyed your pep talks at the beginning of the dvds. They have made a permanent impact. Thanks again.

"YOURE AWESOME"
John, Just thought I’d give you a shout-out and say “Thank you” for helping me pass the DRE Exam on the 1st attempt. This was actually the 2nd time I had to take the exam due to the fact I let my license lapse 15yrs ago. I took Lumbleau Real Estate School then and passed the 1st try also. I currently have friends trying to pass the DRE test and have failed. I told each of them that I was scheduled to take the exam and I was going through Lumbleau. They didn’t know what I was talking about so I showed them your web-site and how you administer your courses. Then, when it was my turn to go into L.A. and take the test, everyone was curious how I’d do. 4 days after taking the exam, I showed them the DRE page and showed them I passed!! Greatest testimonial you could ever publish. I think a few called you right after they saw my results. Thanks again John!! You’re awesome!! Sincerely,
Brian Head

"I KNEW I HAD PASSED"
Dear Mr. Lumbleau, When I decided that I was going to pursue Real Estate, I had no idea where to turn for my exam course. I looked online,found your school and after researching, I signed up. Last week I took the test and was the second person out of the exam. The proctor looked at me and asked if I was sure I was done. I smiled and said, "yes" because I knew I had passed. I got the news yesterday and it was confirmed. Your course works, Mr. Lumbleau and was so affordable. I am blessed to have found your school. Thank you for providing such outstanding material and support. Warm wishes, 
Debbie Hoogestraat


"PASSED ON MY FIRST ATTEMPT"
Dear John,I wanted to thank you for not only providing a great resource via your online courses, but thank you for personally responding to questions I had along the way.

Thanks again, I’m sure I’ll be back in the near future for additional courses. I’ll definitely refer your Lumbleau method to others.

Hi John, Just wanted to say thank you for the great course. I just received my salesperon license and already have 3 offices that want me to work for them. I finished the test so quick the administrator thought I was giving up as I was the 1st one done and there was so much time left. She advised me to spend more time reviewing the test but I knew almost every answer without a struggle. I told her I am confident that I passed and a review was not needed. Anyway, let the new career begin. Thank you again,
Rick Barrett

I PASSED THE CaliforniaReal Estate Exam... Dear Mr. Lumbleau, I am so happy that I purchased your salesperson's course and studied in the privacy of my home on the computer. I enjoyed the live lessons, playing each chapter over and over again until I felt comfortable at digesting the material. I tested myself with the multiple choice questions until I felt strong enough to schedule and take the RE Test. I PASSED the test in 2 hours time. I would recommend the Lumbleau concept to all that who ask for a school referral.

John Contabile


"I BREEZED THRU IT"
Fear had me paralized. I looked at doing Real Estate for 10 yrs but was so afraid of failure that I wouldn't jump in. It was at the moment that I said I really 'want it' that I became serious and began the journey. I watched the CD's, studied the text and took the on line tests; which got me ready. I was prepaired and yes, still afraid, however, when I took the state exam I breezed thru it AND was finished in 1.5 hrs. Thank you John Lumbleau, if it weren't for your program I would still be 'wishin' and hopin'.... thank you.
Angela Bates


"I WAS THE THIRD ONE TO FINISH"
John, you were responsible for my success in passing RE exam with flying colors the first time. I was nervous going into the exam but when I started to take it I felt as though I knew most of the answers. Of the 40 plus exam takers that day I was the third one to finish. I could see the frustration on alot of the other peoples faces. No doubt they didn't take your prep course.Thanks for all of your help thus far.
Tim Farr


"YOU KNOW HOW TO GET THE JOB DONE"

I will be contacting you for the rest of my course work. You know how to get the job done. Thanks

" I RESEARCHED ALL THE SCHOOLS OUT THERE AND LUMBLEAU WAS THE BEST VALUE. "
Feel free to use my testimonial I passed. I am very busy so I decided to go for my real estate license using the Internet and my computer. I researched all the schools out there and Lumbleau Real Estate Schools was the best value. I studied using my computer and the tests and followed instructions exactly as they told me. I had questions as I was going through my test and every time I received a prompt response. I passed the test the very first time and I know for sure I would not have passed had it not been for Lumbleau Real Estate School. Richard Garcia

"WALKING OUT OF THE EXAM ROOM I KNEW I PASSED!!!"
I can't thank you enough for the amazing lectures and practice exams. I had to take the exam twice BECAUSE I didn't follow your prescribed studying method. The second time I devoted the time to complete your lectures and practice exams and walking out of the exam room I KNEW I PASSED!!! LISTEN TO MR. LUMBLEAU!!! Taking the test was so much easier the second time as I had already seen nearly all of the questions.....and I was one of the first people to finish!!! I not only passed the exam this time.....I feel as though I have a better understanding of my future career!!Thanks and see you when I take the broker exam!!!

Mr. Lumbleau, after using your study material, I took the sales exam for the first time in Anaheim last Thur. I passed! I have been told by several people that nobody passes the first time. I guess that they weren't talking about Lumbleau students. Thanks.

"I LIKED HOW YOU EXPLAINED ALL THE CONCEPTS"
I just wanted to let you know that I PASSED the salesperson exam that I took on October 18, 2006. Your school is the best! I really liked how you explained all the concepts so well. I really gained a great understanding of all the important real estate topics that were on the exam and this really helped me to pass the exam successfully. I felt really prepared when I took the exam. Thanks for offering such a great course! It truly is the best out there!!!

Mr. Lumbleau: You are the epitomy of real estate. You "ARE" the profession of real estate. Your course is designed for winners. I passed my test on the first try. If you study the way Mr. Lumbleau tells you- YOU WILL NOT FAIL. I am not just somebody who studied to pass their RE test. I am now somebody who understands and respects the Principles of the Real Estate Profession. As Mr. Lumbleau taught. Thanks Mr. Lumbleau. You don't just teach it...

Mr. Lumbleau, I wanted to let you know that I passed the Salespersons' exam taken on 9/13/06. My sincerest thanks go to you for inspiring me to be the best student and to be consistent and diligent in my studies. Given that I am mother of 8 and 10 year old daughters, a wife and work outside the home 12-13 hour days, it took me 5 months to get through the program. Thank you so much for your leadership in this industry. You are a great mentor and I am very much looking forward to continuing my real estate education through Lumbleau Real Estate School. God Bless you, Mr. Lumbleau! Warmest Regards,

It is such an uplifting feeling having passed the real estate exam (Take 1) which I took on in Oakland! As I was taking the exam, I knew right away that I am going to pass it. That was the easiest licensing exam I have ever taken in my whole life! Thank you very much for helping me prepare for it. I also wanted you to know how much I have enjoyed listening to your motivational talks---what a confidence-booster!
Emilie Cueva


"THE PRACTICE EXAMS REALLY HELPED PULL ALL THE MATERIAL TOGETHER"
Hi, I just got notification that I passed the state exam on the first try. I used the DVD course and the hard copy book course together. The practice exams really helped pull all the material together and make it gel. I was amazed at how many people waiting to take their exam told me they were on their 2nd or 3rd try. Non of them were lumbleau students. I highly recommend this course to anyone who wants to make a career of real estate.
Chuck Emigh


"I HAVE NEVER BEEN SO INSPIRED DURING ANY OF THE SELF-HELP COURSES I HAVE TAKEN IN THE PAST"
Just wanted to say I passed the state exam (with only 3 weeks of study and on the first try) The lumbleau course is the best thing since slice bread and I will be recommending it heavily to anybody i come in contact with. The material is superb and to the point but the most valuable thing about it is John Lumbleaus motivational coaching and the secrets of success he gives throughout the course. I have never been so inspired to work as hard as I did during any of the self-study courses I have taken in the past. You guys are doing a GREAT JOB and KUDOS to John Lumbleau and everybody else at the school. I'm a Lumbleau student for life !! Eli
Eli


"I DON'T THINK I WOULD HAVE MADE IT WITHOUT YOU"

To be honest with you I don't think I would make it without you. You helped me successfully to reach my goal and I am very very excited and again thank you very much. I will give you more referral. Thank you and god bless.

"I KNEW WHEN I LEFT THE TESTING ROOM I HAD PASSED"
Hi John! I wanted to tell you that I am soooo pleased with your course!! I passed my real estate salesperson course today!! I studied hard but I knew when I left the testing room that I had passed. I had taken another course and passed my principles exam. However, when I started to study for the test with this school, I was frustrated. After a month I wanted to give up. Then a friend of mine told me about your course. I ordered it and knew right away that I was going to be well prepared to the take the test. I will also be taking real estate practice and mortgage loan brokering through your school. I look forward to my next class with you! I will also tell anyone that wants to take the real estate course that there is NO OTHER school but Lumbleau if he/she wants to pass the FIRST time! Thank you so much!
Keithe Condiff


"IT WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE WITHOUT YOUR FABULOUS STUDY MATERIALS"
Mr. Lumbleau, I just wanted to thank you for this wonderful training course. I passed my test on 7/7/06 first try. This would not have been possible if it were not for your FABULOUS study materials and online tests. I will never be able to thank you enough for providing me with all the valuable knowledge that you have so gracously shared with all of us - your students. Thank you again from the bottom of my heart.
Pam Joseph


"MR. LUMBLEAU IS UNIQUE AND YOU WILL FEEL HE IS WITH YOU DURING THE TEST"
This is the best school for Real Estate. I took my test and passed the first time. Other examinees taking the test told me they had been trying to take the test and were on their 6th try. Mr.Lumbleau is unique, and you will feel he is with you during the test. Each question you see you will remember a distinct story he told you and you then will remember the right answer. WOW HES AMAZING. I LOVE THIS GUY!!!
Domarina Beitsayad


"EVERY QUESTION WAS FAMILIAR DUE TO YOUR EXCELLENT PROGRAM"
Great test prep. Ordered RE Principles and passed my sales test. Every question was familiar due to your excellent program. It was so easy, that I am now thinking I will just go ahead and do the broker's program. Thanks again.
Cynthia Mayling


"IT TOOK ME ABOUT 30 MINUTES TO FINISH THE ENTIRE EXAM"
Mr. Lumbleau: I meant to thank you and tell you that I passed my Real Estate exam. I passed on the first try. It took me about 30 minutes to finish the entire exam. Thanks to you and your wonderful course. I loved it because it allowed me to go at my own pace, especially with a busy schedule yet you really make sure that you understand the material. Keep up the good work!
Kristine Wallace


"I PASSED!! I WAS THE FIRST ONE DONE IN 1.5 HOURS"
I PASSED ! I was the first one done, in 1.5 hours, hesitated only on a few questions, had your book in the car and double checked myself when I was done on the questions I hesitated on and I did get them right. I PASSED!!!!!! Not sure if being the first one done was good or bad, so when I got home that afternoon I said this to my husband and his quote was "either you know the info or you don't". Thank you so much, I really believe the way your study program works, with the repetition, especially on the practice exams did it for me. I PASSED!!! . I PASSED!!!! I wish the DRE would tell you the score. Thanks again.
Sheila A. Boutte


"I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW MUCH I AM INDEBTED I AM TO YOUR INTERESTING AND ENCOURAGING LIVE VIDEO LECTURES"
Dear Mr. Lumbleau, I took the Real Estate Principles Final Exam and I passed it with an applausible score on my first attempt. I'm so proud of myself and I can't tell you how happy I am and how much indebted I am to your many interesting and encouraging live video lectures.Thank you so much! It certainly was a great & valuable learning experience taking your wonderful class and passing it! You're awesome! Thanks a million again for your thoroughness, thoughtfulness, professionalism, expertise and positive inspirations. I'm sure will refer many more students to you in the near future. Hopefully, someday I'll be as successful as you or at least, nearly half that (wishful thinking). Respectfully,
Huong Tran


"BY THE TIME I COMPLETED THE ACTUAL EXAM THERE WAS NO DOUBT THAT I HAD PASSED"
John, Thank you so much for your course. I passed on my first attempt. I worked hard studying the videos, PDF documents, lesson review exams, and practice exams. By the time I completed the actual exam, there was no doubt in my mind that I had passed the test. My passing results this morning proved the value of your program. I thank you!
Paul Caloca


"IT WAS YOUR TERRIFIC PROGRAM THAT MADE THE WHOLE THING SEEM EASY"
Hi John, I just took the exam and I'd rather say it was your terrific program that made the whole thing seem easy as opposed it having been fairly simple. The only way I could fail is if I missed a line and all my answer were one line off. I was amazed at the small about of math. I took test 995 and I used my calculator three times and they were very easy question, one on acreage, one interest rates and one on a cap rate valuation. I was done after about an hour and made myself stay to double check and stew over some of the tough ones but I was very pleased with my degree of preparedness. Thanks again for a great program, I look forward to taking my additional courses with you. Regards, 
John Brodey


Dear Mr. Lumbleau, I just want to thank you for your help. I PASS the exam for the first time!!! I appreciate your help. Best regards,
Mary Gay nanoz


"I SMOKED THAT TEST! I FEEL CONFIDENT I GOT AT LEAST 90% OR BETTER"
I recently completed the exam for my real estate license, and have receive notice that I passed. Thank you for creating such a wonderful learning system. Your internet course was simple to use, yet was very complete in the information provided. I smoked that test! I feel confident I got at least 90% or better. There wasn't a single question on the exam that was not covered by your course. And although I methodically and deliberately read each question on the exam, I was still one of the first people to complete my exam. Additionally, I want to add that I felt your delivery and communication on the training videos was exemplary. Sincerely, 
Ray Deckert


"ABOUT 85% OF THE QUESTIONS WERE ONES WITH WHICH I WAS DIRECTLY FAMILIAR FROM YOUR COURSE"
I just wanted to drop you a quick note of thanks for your exam passing principles course. While I did not count, I would estimate that about 85% of the questions were ones with which I was directly familiar from your course. The rest were very similar to the material and questions from the course. The math related questions were very few (about 8 or 9) in number and of the very easy variety. I estimate that there were about 75 to 100 people taking exams, and although I did not feel that I was going particularly fast, I was among the first three or four that completed the test (less that 90 minutes). I sure that anyone who takes your course and does all the work will pass with room to spare. Again, thanks for providing the program. Regards,
Harold Fraser


I would just like to thank you for your excellent real estate course. I just took my state examination and passed it on the first try. I will recommend your course to my friends and family. I look foward to completing my continuing education in real estate with the Lumbleau School.
Billy Dishman


Dear Mr. Lumbleau, Wow! What a wonderful way to begin my real estate career. I just got word yesterday that I passed the California Real Estate Salesperson's' Exam. I was the 5th person done and I by no means rushed to take the exam. I felt very confident. But more importantly, I feel that the motivational portion of this exam training course is the real value. I can't even place a number on what I believe to have gained on this portion of the program. And to add even more value you include a wonderful sales training section that gave me a true understanding of what I want to do in the start of my career in Real Estate. The seven weeks I spent with you is indeed the foundation I needed to head for my successes. Thank you,

Dear Mr. Lumbleau, So many thanks for your excellent course - I found out that I passed my state exam on Thursday and today (Monday) I was hired by a broker! I can't wait to start. Your preparation for the state exam could not have been any better - almost all the questions were completely familiar from the practice exams. I gained a great deal from the motivational part of the course as well. I will now purchase my next two courses from you, and once again, thank you, thank you, thank you! Kind regards,
Susan Rutz


Dear John, I would like to sincerely thank you for the preparation you provided me for the Salesperson Exam. I went into the test with confidence, and I passed my first time! I have recommended this course to many of my friends and will continue to do so. Your natural charisma and teaching style made learning fun. Once again, thank you. Sincerely,
Alexandra Moraru


Hey John, I just wanted to take the opportunity to thank you for a job well done. Not only did I pass the exam with ease, but I now have the confidence to go out there and do what it takes to be successful. if it wasn't for this course, I dont know if I would have been able to pass this test. Thanks again John!
Adam Keller


Dear Mr. Lumbleau, I wanted to let you know that I passed my exam on April 6th. Thank you so much for your wonderful program. I recieved a very early exam date with only one month to study and I STILL passed. I was very concerned that I wouldn't, but when I went in to take my test I felt very confident, and the test was a breeze, thanks to your organized study courses.
Penny Tuffendsam


Dear Mr. Lumbleau: Please be advised my wife and I successfully pass the California Real Estate test (Jan., 31st 2006) thanks to your wonderful teaching program. We want to thank you for your part in our move toward success. We are also recommending others to you. Cordially,
Dr. B. E. Byrd, Jr. Pastor


Mr. lumbleau, I just want to thank you for giving me the support that I needed . Your course is very helpful that is why I was able to pass the test last March 24. Again thanks so much and I will definitely tell other people who want to go into real estate to call you.

Thank you for your time and help, and more importantly thank you for the successful teachings that your great course has provided. I am so happy to say that I passed on my first try. Thank you again for the knowledge provided. I will be taking my next 2 required courses through your online school. Thanks, because I can't say it enough (one very happy and satisfied customer)
Lindsay Mills


Good news....I passed!! I just found out I passed my test today!! I'm so grateful I stumbled upon your website after searching the internet to find a legimate DRE crash course! I got burned a couple months ago when I took a traditional weekend crash course that a realtor company offered for $100. I studied ALL the material they gave me and I FAILED the test!!! But no wonder because I found myself guessing on half of the questions (not a good feeling)!! After going through your course, I was MORE THAN PREPARED for the test and after it was over, I knew that I passed!! Again, thank you so much for this valuable resource. I can see very clearly how you can GUARNTEE a student passing. I've already recommended your website to some other loan officers in my office. This was money well spent!!!
Dave Martin


I passed my exam on the first try. It was amazing how it felt like I was taking a practice test at home since the questions were so familiar. I was also the second one done in the entire exam. Thanks so much for your great course. I will definitely be back for other courses. Debra Gillis
Debra Gillis


Mr. Lumbleau, I took my exam on Feb. 14, 2006, They told us to wait five days for our results. I just called the voice response system to obtain my results. Its only been 4 days but my results are up. PASSED!! Thought I would leave some feedback for you and say thank you for this course. Thanks for answering any questions I had within minutes. I have 4 friends who I have recommended and will be registering with you soon. Thanks again.
Ali Haider

Troy Barela


I want to thank you for preparing me for the exam. I took your video course, and answered all the questions in all of the sections. I took the test on January 30, 2006, and just received notification that I passed on my first attempt. Your course was thorough and well put together. Your style of teaching is great, as evidenced by your longevity and success. I will not hesitate to recommend the course to others. Thanks again.
Kerry Blount


Dear Mr. Lumbleau, I just wanted to tell you last week I took the sales exam downtown.

I would like to thank you for your great online course It really works.....THANK YOU AGAIN MR.LUMBLEAU!!!
Marvin Hemmans


Dear Mr. John Lumbleau, thank you very much for your wonderful course. Your certainty that I would pass the State exam the first time around despite my worries showed how right you were. You remind me of a John Wayne or William Shatner of the Starship Enterprise. It is fun knowing you. Thanks for everything!
Arthur Joseph


I PASSED MY EXAM!!!!! Thank you for all of your help and for your awesome website!!! It made learning fun!
Diane


I took my sales person exam on the 9th of January and I wanted to let you know I passed even though I did not finish all the practice exams. Thank you! They helped alot and I learned a lot.
Yesenia Luevano


Hello! John L, I wish to say thank you again for your wonderful instructions that greatly helped me to pass my real estate state liscensing examination the first attempt. Every thing you discussed in your lectures was staring at me on the test paper, the entire test was to take three and a quarter hours to finish, I finished in one and a half hours with confidence that I reproduced what I learned from John Lumbleau. You are a great lecturer, knowledgeable with the great ability to impact knowledge. You sure delivered and I got my money's worth and more. Thank you so much, you are simply the best in the field of REAL ESTATE!
Comfort Ekeledo


John Lumbleau and staff, I PASSED!!! It really doesn't come as any surprise...I followed your program as directed and I walked into the exam prepared and confident. The throughness of your program really makes the difference. Thank you!
Hank Montgomery


I passed my Real Esate Exam on December 29,2005. This was my first attempt at taking the test. The review questions and DVD helped with explanations and applications.
Jennifer Shaw-Meyers


Thank you Mr. Lumbleau for helping me to pass the R.E. salespersons exam on my first attempt on December 22,2005. I finished the exam so quickly (in about an hour in a half) it scared me. I checked my answers twice just to verify I understood the questions completely, and I did. I will strongly recommend your exam passing course to anyone looking not just to pass the salesperson exam, but preparing for a career, which you teach perfectly. Cordially,
Ophelia Groomes


John, I'm soooooo excited to tell you that I passed the Salesperson CA state exam!!!! I'm impressed by your course so much that I am telling everyone about it. How often is it that the owner of a company that has been in business since the 30's (father then now son) answers the phone when you call for any information. Amazing! You are obviously from the "old school" where customer service is imperative. I love that. Also, you are the "MAN" as far as I'm concerned when giving the lectures. Even though the other lecturers were good, you are GREAT! When I sat down to take the test every one of the questions read like the ones I had studied in your course. I am 61 years old and would like to tell everyone that you are never too old to explore a new career. Thanks again John,
Joan Therieau


Hello Mr. Lumbleau, I passed the test thanks to your course. Of all the tutorials to pass the real estate test your information is the most accurate and comprehensive. Your enthusiasm and delivery is the best I have ever seen from any teacher. I am so happy I chose the lumbleau schools. Your creation of a real estate salesman is one in a million. I want you to know i have learned more from you than any other person . Sincerely,
George Edginton


Mr. Lumbleau, Today, I just found out I passed my Salesperson exam. You motivated me the whole way through the course and I cannot thank you enough. I have spent the last 10 years in the Information technology field and it has been good to me. I will refer your classes to Anybody and Everybody. John Lumbleau is a motivator. His courses work. If you follow his curriculum YOU PASS the exam. It's that simple. Are you self motivated? If not, John can help you. Thanks to John Lumbleau and I am on my way. Much better than being stuck in the runway of an airport. I have taken flight with John Lumbleau. Sincerely,
Don Foley


Mr. Lumbleau, I passed!!!! Thank you so much. Your progam is incredible. Thank you, thank you, thank you. You are a true blessing to have. I am recommending your program to alot of my friends and family. Thank you again-your loyal student. I will be contacting you very soon to complete the required continued education.
C.Williams


Thank's Guy's !!! I passed my test on Oct 26!! THE FIRST TIME ! it was easy!! Now I'm an Agent with Coldwell Banker's in Hollister Ca. your courses are THE BEST! My friend used the "OTHER GUY'S Course" and it took him 3 times at the test to pass. Thanks for the great education!! Many, Many Thanks
Bradley J Klemek


Dear John, Just a quick note to let you know that I passed my state salesman exam – first time. Just a few weeks ago I did not know a "riparian right" from a "mechanics' lien". Now I am on my way to making my first deal in real estate. It's all due to your awesome course (and a little work on my part!) Thanks
Simon Foord


Dear Mr. Lumbleau, Just a note to “Thank You” for a course that enabled me to pass the sales person exam on the first try. When I started the exam I knew right away that I was fully prepared to answer the questions easily. I also found that your explanations in the DVD set helped a great deal in understanding some information that could be confusing. Thank You Again,
Gary Medinger


I would like to extend my highest recommendation for the Lumbleau Salesperson and Broker Exam Preparation Courses. I successfully completed both the Salesperson and Broker test on the first attempt. I can assure that, being on the far side of 50, it was not from a having good memory. Quite frankly, in my case it would have been impossible without the knowledge I gained from taking the Lumbleau course. On the State’s Salesperson test, I found that many questions had a choice of answers where more than one was correct. Fortunately, the Lumbleau course had prepared me for this type of question. After completing the Lumleau course I also completed a similar course from a competitor (xxxxxx). It lacked the in depth background for the answers. The font was too small. On a dial-up connection their server was slow to display the next question. I would like to give my personal thanks to John Lumbleau for producing such a fine course and making it so affordable. One other think, when you have a question and call, you will very likely have John himself answer the phone. Try getting someone at any other company that actually knows the material in their course! 
Wade Einkauf


I just wanted to thank John Lumbleau for being one the greateset real estate instructors in the business. His passion and teaching techincs helped me pass my state exam on the first try. Once again thank you and see you in about two years for my brokers license. 
Alfred Younan


Mr. Lumbleau, it was a real pleasure having you as my personal instructor. I passed on the first try on Sept 28. I feel confident that the foundation for my new career is extremely solid because of your abilities of teaching. I wish that I could meet you in person and thank you. I learned more than I thought and I will recommend your name throughout our profession. The main message I have received is integrity, and I know you speak the truth. I believe that if I never stray from integrity then success will naturally follow. Thanks again,
Ronald Filetti


John, Just found out I passed my agent test on the first go-round. I'm 58 yrs. old and testing has never been my strong suit. I must admit, I studied your coursework daily for a month and a half, but your course and questions were right on. I had seen 99% of the material before. I finished the test in an hour and forty minutes. I'll be back for the follow-up courses. Thanks
Al Webb


I enrolled in your salesperson exam course, my studying lasted for 8 weeks. I felt confident that I will make it. I was surprised how easy and familiar most of the questions were. I checked my test result today thru the internet and there it is...I PASSED...with only 1 take. I would like to thank you, Mr. Lumbleau for those encouraging words in your videos and very helpful explanations on each topics in the book. The practice questions as well as the Exam Updates were well prepared and helped me in retaining most of the right answers. I would definitely recommend your review course to my friends.
Marlene Ludders


I PASSED THE TEST!, THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU! 
Marjorie A. Erickson


Dear Mr. Lumbleau, I would like to thank you and your staff for the exellent school. I took the state exam on 08/30/05 and just found out that I passed. I was amazed that I knew about 85% of the questions right away from taking your course. The other 15% that I had not seen before were hard but because of your class, the princapals where known and applied. I love how you told us to skip over the hard and math questions that we don't know rigt away and come back to them later. It works great! Less pressure. Many of the other students were laboring over the test, not this Lumbleau student! Thanks again and I will use Lumbleau School again for continuing education and a Brokers course. Sincerly,
Scott Williams


Dear John, It great being in your internet corse supported by the best DVD course I have ever been into.Your motivation and the Positive Mental Attiude you have provided me that Reminded so much of Dr. Napoleon Hill have helped to achieve my first goal.You are one of a kind. Keep up the great work and mau God bless your school and your family... I PASSED thank you AGAIN.
Shihadeh Sayage ( Charlie)


Dear John: Just wanted to send you a quick e-mail to thank you for the excellent course. My husband and I enrolled together for the course and just found out that both of us passed the California Real Estate Exam we took on August 12, 2005. At ages 65 and 70 we are ready to begin a new career! This was our first try. Thanks for being there to answer our questions and guide us along the way. Sincerely,
Patsy and Dewaine Breeden


Dear Mr. Lumbleau, I just visited the CA Department of Real Estate e-License website and just learned that I passed my California Department of Real Estate Salesperson Examination. The exam started at 7:45 a.m. After 15 minutes of orientation, we started taking our examinations. I turned in my exam and walked out of the room at 9:17 a.m. The only reason that I did not walk out of the examination room at 8:45 a.m. was that I simply couldn't believe that the California Salesperson exam was too EASY! There is no was that any student of average intelligence, who faithfully watches your DVD's and tackles the online questions, can fail to pass the exam unless they deliberate intend to fail. I have been recomending your course to anyone I know that is interested in obtaining their real estate licenses. The only complaint about of whole exam experience that I had was that I had placed three hours worth of change in the parking meter and couldn't get a refund for the hour and a half that I didn't use.
Sean Thee


Mr Lumbleau on 8-9-05 I passed the Salesperson exam on my first attempt. I was the first to finish, and I felt good because the material was fresh in my mind. Mr Lumbleau, you are an excellect intructor, may G-D continue to bless the Lumbleau Real Estate School, its staff. your family and you with continued success, and may your school always be available to serve the Real Estate needs of the public. Thank You!
Hamidullah A. Saahir


Dear Mr. Lumbleau, I just wanted to inform you that I had passed the sales exam, thanks to you excellent test prep program. It has got to be the best money I have ever spent. Although I have no idea, I probably received a high mark because it seemed as though 99% of the exam questions came out of your program. I actually took the salesperson course from a mediocre school called (name on request), and I just had this gut feeling that their 1200 questions just weren't enough, so I searched for the most resonable priced and reliable school. Thank the Lord, I managed to find your website and started working on the test prep program for less than 2 weeks. It was gruelling, but it was well worth the effort. Once again, thank you so much for your wonderful program. I am planning to spread the word about your school that it is the best Real Estate school in California. Sincerely, Kristina Kim P.S. I also want to thank you for resonding my e-mails when I was having a little difficulties with the program. They were just few things but you did not loose your patience or get annoyed by them. It says a lot about you and your achool.
Kristina Kim


Dear Lumbleau School, I recently took the Salesperson course that you offer and took the state real estate exam on June 10, 2005. I found the course to be extremely easy to follow, well-done, and the instructors very entertaining. I gained a thorough knowledge of what I needed to know for the exam and passed the first time. I have already recommended your school to everyone who asks. You're doing a great job, keep it up!
Jill Curry


Dear John: I want to thank you so very much for your inspired and remarkably effective DVD real estate course! I passed the exam the first time on August 1st! I must say, it was much easier than I imagined thanks to the preparation provided by your step-by-step approach. I saw many of the exact same questions I had in your practice exams and was very prepared! Your motivational coaching -which is infused in the course- was at first something I thought I could do without-- but after a few times I realized it helped my mind open up to learning and to remember just who I am and what I needed to do! Thanks again John, you are a Godsend. I hope you live forever!
Nick Mathe Folsom


Passed of the 1st try. Thanks!
Troy Huntington


Hi: I took your salesperson exam and passed my test -- first one done at the exam (finished in 55 minutes). Loved it!!! Thank you again.
Barbara Corley


I just wanted to send you a note and thank you for offering such a comprehesive course in Real Estate Principals. I have just been notified by the DRE that I have passed the state exam on the first try. I was so prepared after taking your course that I found the exam to be extremely easy. Sincerely,
Mike Sasso


Dear Mr. Lumbleu I wanted to let you and your staff know that I passed the Real Estate Exam and I have to tell you that "The Ultimate in Real Estate Education" is NOT just a slogan, but the most concise teaching I have come across in the last two years. My mother was a student of yours 30 years ago in Los Angeles and passed the State Exam the first time. She is now a broker. Your crash course has mastered the core of the exam, and I want to thank you. Good journey to you, your company and to future agents.Kindest regards, 
Michele Haller


John - I just received word that I was successful on my first attempt! There is no doubt if it weren't for your class, the real estate exam would have been much more difficult to pass. Just wanted to say THANK YOU. You broke things down in a way that I could understand easily. Your lessons and practice exams were excellent preparation tools. Best regards,
Debbie Moss


Dear Mr Lumbleau, Thank you for all your help. I took my sales person exams for the first time and passed. I use your instructions and i really loved it. Sincerely,
Danita Heathington


Dear Mr. Lumbleau: First of all I commend you for not only offering a fantastic course, I thank you for all your help along the way. You have made it so easy to get questions answered and I was pleased to be able to talk to you on the phone directly. I took the Salesperson exam on June 27, 2005 and just found out I passed the exam on the first try!!! Your course is all anyone needs to pass the exam on the first try. Most of the questions on the exam were straight from your course. I finished the exam in less than an hour with confidence knowing when I left that I had passed. I have already recommended your course to several people. Thank you for your help. Sincerely,
Terri Rowitz


I passed the sales person's exam on June 18 for the first attempt. I signed up for the couse 2 months ago. It was a great learning exprience and I would certainly recommend Lumbleau courses to others. 
Min Kong


John: Just a short note to let you know I received my pass notice from DRE. Thanks for all your help in passing first time around! 
Tom Tolman


Your course was great in helping me pass the exam as I have no prior experience in the industry. I spent a average 3 hours a day for about ten days taking your course and passed the exam I was in the top 10 of people who finished first. thanks again. 
Frederick Rorr


I took your course over the past 6 months studying a couple hours a day and passed the state exam 1st time. By far this is a great self taught program you have put together and I will recommend anyone new to use it accordingly. Thank you, 
Kevin Jenkins \


Mr. Lumbleau, I just wanted to let you know how much I appreciate your program. After being confused by numerous other programs over the past 12 months, the Lumbleau Exam Passing Course shed (flood)light on what I really needed to know to pass the state RE exam. Not only that, but I finally feel like I have a grasp on our RE regulations - when other programs just wanted me to memorize Q&A's. > I walked out of the exam knowing that I had finally achieved my goal of passing. (I only had 31 questions set aside after my first pass!) > As I am sure you have been told numerous times over your years of educating, you offer the most comprehensive, to-the-point program available...I should know, I've tried almost every one in the last year! > Be assured that when anyone asks which program I recommend, yours will be the only one I mention....I already have several times since I got my results on Tuesday. 
Neil Carlson


Thank you, I just got my exam results I passed!! Thank you so much for the lessons you gave.. Out of over 4 hundred I must have been like the fifth one to finish my test. 
Kathy Barela


May 26, 2005 Mr. Lumbleau, let me say thank you for helping me pass the Salesperson Exam on my first attempt. I bought another program a while back, and couldn't make sense of the material. From the start of video lesson 1, I knew your course was for me. Straight forward, no-nonsense, to the point. Your online questions following eash lesson allowed me to see how the State was going to test me. The repitition of the questions reinforced the material studied; the explanations helped me to understand the subtleties that would have otherwise resulted in a wrong answer on the State exam. I completed the State exam in an hour and fifteen minutes. Out of the 150 questions, I only skipped 19 on the first run through. On the others, for the most part, the answer came to me BEFORE I looked at the 4 possible answers. Anyone who wants to pass the State exam the first time, should look no further than the Lumbleau Real Estate Schools. THANK YOU!! THANK YOU!! THANK YOU!! 
Steve Aimar


I've passed my State exam. Just wanted to say THANK YOU. I couldn't have done it without your teaching style and technique. You're The Best! 
Aileen Pyburn


Hi John, Just writing to let you know how thrilled I am with the schooling I received from your Salesperson Exam Prep Course. I found out day before yesterday that I passed the examiniation but felt so confident that I had no doubt of my results. Not only did the questions on the exam seem so elementary compared to my Lumbleau lessons, but many of the questions in the Appraisal Lesson were right there on my test! I sailed through the exam and heard others outside the exam room complaining how hard the test was and that nothing they had studied was on the exam! I did my best to recommend Lumbleau to them should they need to test again and am convinced that your program gave me the edge to pass this exam armed with not just knowledge but understanding. Thanks again!
Pam Atchison


Mr. Lumbleau, After contacting you on the phone, (I was surprised) and a real human (You) answered, I decided to order your course. I had previously taken the California Real Estate Agents exam, three times and failed by one question, each time. I rescheduled the exam, two weeks later, I completed one cd each day for the next two weeks, when I started the exam I realized something different, I absolutely knew the material, I had 3 1/2 hours to finish the exam, I finished in 44 minutes (the first one done) I truly believe I did not miss one question. When I checked the Web Site, I knew it was going to say PASS, and it did. Thank You for your excellent material. I am now going to take the Broker Classes so I can get my brokers license. You may use this as a testimonial. Sincerely,
Norris Stephenson, Jr.


I just passed the CA agent test (1st time)...and I thank you for the great course.
James Chen


Dear Mr. Lumbleau: Many thanks for your school and your approach to teaching. I completed your course; DVD’s and practice exams, including the updates. Went to the exam on May 2, 2005 and passed. The instruction that you gave and the approach to taking the exam was exactly what is needed. I spent several hours in seven weeks preparing for the exam and I knew that I passed when I was finished. Your course is the one that anyone should take who is looking to learn real estate principles and to pass the exam on the first go around. Again, thank you for a well designed school of instruction and instilling the confidence and motivation that each student needs to be successful in real estate. Best Regards
Dennis Adams


Hello John, I would like to thank you for your courses and your time to help me pass my real estate exam on my first attempt. Without any doubts, I know I did really well I did on the exam and all I could say is "well taught." Everyday I listen to your courses not only to pick up information I missed, but also for encouragement. Listening to your speech before you teach your lesson is the best part because what you speak is not only true, but also motivates anyone to be successful in anything. Purchasing your courses the best investment I ever made. Thank you for letting me have a piece of the gold.
Thieu Nguyen


You dont know how thankfull I am. I flew thru this test. I was amazed how close the test questions were to yours. Many of them were identical. I will advice anybody who wants to pass to take your program. It is really worth it. Thanks again. 
Basel Mustafa


Dear Mr. Lumbleau, Just want to say thank you for the Exam Passing Course. I passed The Exam the 1st time. so many of the questions on the exam were the same as the course materials. I even ran out of time and only finish 2/3 of the course and a couple practice exam and the 2 updates, but it was enough information to pass. Thanks Again, Dawn
Dawn Ann


First of all, a Big thank you to my mentor Mr. Lumbleau. Took the test in Oakland on 04-25-05 and received a notice of congratulation on 04-27-05. "HAIL TO THE CHIEF!" Mr. Lumbleau. Thanks! 
Kevin Cuevas


Mr.Lumbleau, Thank G-d & thank you sir, I would never have made it without you. I tookthe exam on April the 12th, it was tough but your course made it simple. All the right answers popped up like headlights. It was as though you were sitting by my side during the exam. Donald Trump is a smart businessman but you are the real estate moghul of the millenium. Thank you ever sincerely, Forever GRATEFUL, David Sassoon Gubbay
David Sassoon Gubbay


Hi John, I passed the Salesperson test! Thank you!
Susan Swanson


Thank you for your valuable assistance with the preparation for my current course test. Your availability by telephone and email is only one characteristic of your program that make it stand out above the rest. I passed the California Salesperson test on my first try. I will continue to heartily recommend your courses to my associates. 
J.R. Young


Greetings, I just wanted to send you a quick email letting you know that your course worked!!! I have been studying for the last few months and I have recently taken my test in Sacramento and passed!!! Thank you for your great course and I am VERY happy with my results! My wife is going to get her Real Estate license too and she is going to sign up for your couse as well. Thank you again!!! Successfully yours, David Lewis
David Lewis


Took the CA State Salesperson's Exam to obtain a license on March 24, 2006 and PASSED. Thanks. The Video, the Salesperson Exam Passing Course and Lumbleau's Practice Exam were excellent tools that helped me achieve knowledge to pass the exam. Thanks again. RT Cuadro
RT Cuadro


Hi, John. I bought your Salesperson Exam Prep courses in December 2004 and I took the exam in February 2005 and passed it with flying colors...I'm back again to take the Broker Exam. Thank you so much for not only providing your students with proven exam prep materials, but serving as our mentor, coaching us along the way.
Rachel Santiago


I just wanted to thank you so much. Since signing up for your class, I've been the happiest I've ever been in my life. At 42 years of age now, and with 4 children, selling real estate has been a dream that I never thought to pursue. To me, selling Real Estate was something that I envied or admired others for but never thought that I could or would make it a part of my life. Stumbling across this website was a dream come true. I am so grateful to you for giving me this opportunity and a direction in my life. Thank You, Theresa
Theresa Monnig


Hello John, I am sending this note to tell you that I passed the State salesman exam. First try! Thank you. I want to let you know too that I followed the course just as you have it laid out. Watching the DVDs and doing the study materials connected to the particular DVD. Then I went over all the practice exams and studied anything I may have missed on them. So although this was the first exam I took in many many years I nevertheless went in feeling confident. Again I want to thank you and your team for a well thought out program.
David English


Dear John, Thank you very much for answering my last minute questions the day before the exam last week.....I passed!
Julie McCloskey


I just want to thank you for your DVD course and book. I got my results today and found out that I passed the salesperson exam the first time I took it on 2/25. All of the questions and practice tests really prepared me well. I will definitely recommend you exam course to anyone interested in passing the first time. Thanks again.
Morgan Savage


I JUST RECEIVED MY TEST RESULTS AND I PASSED!!! TOOK THE TEST ON 2-22-05. I CAN'T THANK YOU ENOUGH FOR YOUR COURSE! IT WORKS! THANK YOU AGAIN.
Kay Trimm


I just wanted to tell you how impressed I was I called for some assistance on the web site and you Mr. Lumbleau personaly answered the phone and did not seemed rushed.I also wanted to tell you how much I enjoyed your dvd course it was a great tool I passed the state exam the first time and I had over an hour to spare.I was afraid I skipped half the questions or something.I than went through the test once more.I was still one of the first ones to leave I actually waited for others to leave so I wouldn't be the first. Thanks again and God bless you and yours.
Ken Kellogg


Hi John, I wanted to thank you for the excellent salesperson training course. I took my state exam Jan. 10, 2005 and ACED the 3 hour test in 2 hours. I left the examination room knowing I passed with a 90 plus percent score. It was your training that gave me the knowledge and confidence I needed to accomplish the first important step in my Real Estate career.
Steve Curtice


Testimonial- Unsolicited John, you are the first teacher I have had since 1980. I wasn't sure I could still study like I used to and pass at 45 years old. Both I and my wife passed the examination on the first try. May you live long and continue to prosper. I'll be sure to have all my contacts, and in the future, my agents use your program. I have already bought it for an associate I plan to hire.
Mike Hosley


Just took the state exam and passed.
Your course rocks!
Thanks for being a great instructor, loved the stories
Annabelle Peterson


Because of this wonderful course I passed the real estate exam easily. And you were right about finishing early....I was among the first to complete the test.
Thanks very much!
Kathy Davis


I have used your course to not only pass my exam on the first try, but also passed the referral on to my boyfriend who also passed with your course. Thank you so much,
Gina Iannetti


John, I just wanted to thank you for your program. I took the test on Friday and just found out that I passed! THANKS,
Tom Wirt


John,
Passed the DRE Salesperson's test December 13th, 2004. Did I have to make an effort? Did I have to "log the time"? Yes, as you know, all things of value have a pricetag. Your course, was of great value. Your Father and you have helped my father, brother and I to not only obtain licenses but also to become more successful in any endevour that we have applied ourselves to attain! The Reinhardt family thanks you.
Greg L. Reinhardt


I PASSED FIRST TRY!!!
Thank You Mr. John Lumbleau! I especially loved all your words of wisdom and stories and personal experience! Silly, I know, but it all REALLY WORKED FOR ME!!! I think it is fantastic that you have a forum/outlet to share with so may people. I am glad you used this opportunity to do more than just cover the textbook/test material! And, just like you said...when I sat down to take the test I was familiar with everything, except ONE question, was confident in answering 95 percent of the questions.
I PASSED!!! THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU!!!
Julie Dotson


Mr. Lumbleau,
I loved taking your course! Your lectures were informative and motivating. I took my exam on Nov. 19 and I passed the first time!
Thank you,
Teri Williams


I PASSED WITH FLYING COLORS THANK YOU.
MARIO R DIAZ


Mr. Lumbleau,
I just wanted to tell you that I passed my State Exam on the first try! Thank you for your great material, without the study guide and the latest questions from the State Exam I don't think I would of passed on the first try. The thing that I most appreciate from your videos is how motivational and insperational you are. Thank you, for all of your help!
Sincerely,
Zulma Valenzuela


Dear John,
I wanted to let you know that I passed my state exam on November 22nd. Thank you for your effective Pre-License Exam-Passing Course. Your motivation is what kept me going, the format with the DVD's was comprehensive and the review of the latest question was a big help. I was so nervous but once I read the first couple of questions on the exam I felt confident and prepared. The nervousness went away and I finished early. I would highly recommend your course. Thanks again and I look forward to the brokers Exam passing course.
Cindie Schulz


I passed the test here in Oakland CA. I just wanted to e-mail you and let everyone know that if they follow the program the way you lay it out they will pass the state examination!Thanks for a great program , and I will be following up with the brokers course. P.S. None of the questions on the test were a surprise!
Terry Billings


The exam passing course was very useful in helping me to pass the state exam on my first attempt. I am so impressed, that I ordered the follow up course as well.
Phillip Smith


Mr. Lumbleau,
I passed the State Exam, just thought I'd let you know. I did enjoy your course. I loved the layout of the whole thing and the ease of which it can be used. Thank you for helping me pass.
Sincerely,
Robyn Avanessian


Hello John,
I took the salesperson exam on Oct. 18th and a few days later found out that I passed! I want to thank you for a very comprehensive learning experience. There were many questions that were familiar to me on the exam because of studying your material. thank you again for a great learning experience. I would highly recommend your course to anyone interested.
Robin Blaiwes


I did not believe that I would even be prepared to take the State Exam without going into a classroom. As soon as I ordered the 17 DVD's for the principles, I started studying at home. I did a lot of the Exam practice questions. I passed the State Test on my first attempt. I just want to thank you John for making me feel like I have been in this profession for years. I will always recommend the Lumbleau Schools to anyone.
Patricia Nwaekeke


I am writing to say thank you. I just passed my state exam on my first try on 10/08/04. I was able to finish the test in one hour because I have seen most of the questions on Lumbleau studying materials. I was so glad that I did not skip the updated questions. There are at least 5 questions from it. I love the after exam salesmanship courses DVD too. They are fantastic!!!
Susanna Wang


Hello John,
Just want to let you know that I purchased your soft wear two days before my California Real Estate-State Exam date, and by putting a 32 hours of studying I passed.

Want to thank you for your amazing and magic soft wear which was really easy to use, and keep up good work that you do for people who are interested in Real Estate. In two years I am thinking to take my Brokers exam, so we will be in touch.
Thanks again,
Arsen Kazaryan


Ok thanks!
And may I say I found your course AWESOME. The mannerism in which you speak, your method of delivery, and your personality are unmatched to the many speakers I have seen over the last 10 years. I compliment you on a great course and being a good person. You are the best I have learned from John Lumbleau - may God bless you for all you have done and thanks for the jump on my new career!
Gerritt Poelstra


John,
My partner and I purchased our CA RE Salesman courses from you in early April, 2004. We are very happy to inform you that we BOTH passed the California RE licensee examination on September 13th, 2004 in Oakland, CA - on our first attempt!

Obviously, living outside of California, we wanted to ensure our passing with only one try at the exam. Put most simply, it is because of your thorough and accurate course materials that both of us were able to pass so easily. For that, we cannot thank you enough. The practice and exam review tests were especially helpful in learning the material AND overcoming all of our testing anxiety.

Now we expect to complete our additional course materials so that our initial licenses are good for the full four years. Again, we are very happy to have chosen your superlative and inspiring CA RE course materials.
Stephen L Welthe, Karen K Welthe


Thank you, I passed !
Thanks again.....Next will be the broker's test.
Bonnie Brierton


Dear Mr. Lumbleau:
My name is Russell Chadwell. I passed the state exam in September (first try) using your course! Thank you very much! Your course is direct and to the point. I appreciate that very much.
Thanks again!!
Russell Chadwell


John,
I just wanted to thank you for a great program. I previously went through the XXX XXX School here in XXX XXXX, CA and I failed the test 2 times (69% both times).
I studied your material and passed the first try. Your software is the best I have seen.
Thanks again from a "New Agent".
Fred Hekking


Thank you, Thank you.
I passed the exam on my first try because of your software.
Suzan Vainberg


Good Morning John,
I was able to pass the salesperson exam on 7/26/04, Thank you very much.
Your exams and questions were so helpful I could not have done it with your help.
Nancy Reghab


Dear Mr. Lumbleau,
Thank you for putting together a great Real Estate course. It was a lot but easy to absorb and understand. It definitely prepared me for the exam. I took the exam on June 25, 2004 and passed, 15 days later I got my license. Now, brokers have been calling, inviting me to join them.
Again, thank you.
Sincerely,
Orchid E.


Hi John.
My name Is Jasmin. With your help I got my real estate license. Your course is excelent and I will continue working with you.
THANKS !!!
Jasmin Bajramovic


Dear Mr. Lumbleau,
I just wanted to inform you that I passed the Sales Exam and I'm looking forward to my new career in Real Estate.
Paula Burke


Great Test Results... PASSED!
If it was not for the Lumbleau school, I would not have passed. I was forced to answer the questions based on my understanding of Real Estate Principles. I also went to a weekend crash course (because of unnecessary lack of confidence). Unfortunately, the actual state exam was not compatible with the material provided by the crash course.The whole experience was one of miraculous success!

Thank you for the great education!
Sincerly,
Kurt K. Carr


Dear Mr. Lumbleau,
I just wanted to thank you for all your help with your DVD's and Study Guide.
As of May 14, 2004 I passed my Real Estate Test. I now have the conditional licences.

I think that the combination of DVD's Study Guide and Computer questions was the really ticket.

I know that not many people give you feed back, I just wanted you to know that it was appreciated.
Thanks
Kris Revives


John,
I just wanted to drop you a line and let you know that I took my test this past Monday and "passed". Thank you for your help. I've really enjoyed your courses (I took the DVD course). I'm excited about my future in Real Estate and will be referring everyone I know that is interested in a career in Real Estate to your program.
Thank you,
Sid Kirkland


Dear Mr. Lumbleau,
Thank you for the Real Estate course. I took the exam last week in Los Angeles and passed. Your questions were so good that, if anything, I was overprepared for the exam! I look forward to taking the other required courses in the next several months after I get the license.
Sincerely,
Julia Kuleck


Mr. John Lumbleau
I want to thank you for a great course, not only was it tremendously informative but also exiting and your introductions extremely motivating. I took the exam on June 5th, 2004 and out of a 1000 people, I was one of the first to finish "just under 80 minutes". I knew that I passed the moment I left the Oakland Marriott Convention Center. Every question I encountered was in the Practice Exams.
Thanks again.
Chandra Gardeen


Hi John,
I just wanted to say Thank You for your course materials. I used another school and I failed the exam the first time. Then I ordered your materials, and I passed the exam!!!! The exam updates were also helpful. Many of the questions on the update were the exact questions that were used on the exam.
Thanks Again,
Janet Bonetto


Just wanted to Thank You for your help and your course. I took my salesperson exam last Tuesday for the first and only time and passed.
Thanks again
Cindy Nordstrom


Dear John,
I passed my test. Thank you so much for all of your kind attempts at keeping me going. Hope that I didn't drive you too crazy! I enjoyed your system very much and would recommend it to anyone.
Sincerely,
Carole Cunnington


Mr. Lumbleau,
I cannot thank you enough for providing me with all the tools to pass the exam on the first try. I was totally confident the entire time during the exam unlike the person sitting next to me. He explained before the start of the exam, that he was not a Lumbleau student. Instead he brought tapes from a Real Estate office which only contained hundreds of questions and no explanations. This is for anyone visiting the site for the first time. Don't waste your time and money by looking elsewhere, make the investment and become a Lumbleau student. Very soon, you'll be like the rest of us, anxious to tell the world about your success story.
Lorraine Santirosa


Hello John:
Was I shocked. I started in January taking your course, which I really enjoyed. It was easy to follow and made taking the state test a breeze. I went in with total confidence that you had taught me all I needed to know. I took the test March 27, passed the first try and it is now April 18th and I received my license in the mail yesterday. They said give it a week to find out if you passed, it was 3 days. Then they said to allow 6 - 7 weeks from the date they receiv your license application. Well, it was exactly 10 days from when I mailed it.
Thank you again John.
Wanda Floyd


Thanks John,
Who said, You can't teach an old dog new tricks? It’s been two workdays since I took the salesman exam. I checked the DRE site last night, just to make a test run on how to do it. There it was, my congratulations. Generally speaking your exams were much more difficult than the state exam, and they well prepared me for anything the state threw at me. You had told me over the phone not to worry about the math questions. As it turned out I had 8 math questions on the state exam. All were very simple and I know I got them all correct. I believe I over studied, but it was worth it. I would hate to be looking at having to re-take the state test and waiting out another ten weeks.
Thanks again,
Ron Connick


Mr. Lumbleau,
I want to thank you for your help. I checked with DRE tonight, and I PASSED! I will be in touch with you again later on some of the items you mention on becoming a successful salesman.
The next big hurdle for me is changing careers. I started at the age of 18 in the timber Industry, I an now 46. This is a big change for me. One that I am welcoming with open arms.
Don Luther


Hi John:
You did it...passed salesmen first time. I owe it to your thorough book, and great interactive study software that let me focus on what was important. After taking the test, 4-3-04 I can say there was not one question that your material and study questions did not cover. Its all there. I want to also get my brokers license, and want to refer prospective new Loan Officers to your course.
Thanks again.
Joel Baral


To John Lumbleau,
I want to tell you how much I enjoyed my sales persons course. You made it very easy to understand and I have recommended you to everyone I come in contact with that wants to get into the business. You are very good at what you do and I thank you.
Kory


Dear Mr. Lumbleau,
I would like to take this opportunity to personally thank you for putting together one of the best educational computer based training programs I have seen to date. As a school vice principal, I review educational materials frequently and understand the importance of good study habits. Your course is set up for student success and I would recommend it to anyone who is seriously interested in passing their real estate or brokers exam the first time. It worked for me, and I felt confident when I answered the test questions. I can now move forward with my new career in real estate with self-assurance and knowledge.
Sincerely,
Mark Powell, MA, Ed.


I PASSED!!!!!! (the first time) Thank you so much. My exam date was on the 12th of March and I PASSED!!
Nancy Powers


I just wanted to thank you for providing a fine program which helped me pass the real estate salesperson's exam. As a matter of fact, I was so well prepared that I was in and out of the exam in 40 minutes.
Sincerely,
Joseph Boodanian


Hi John, I was really pleased to receive the pre-license package 33 hour 14 teaching dvd set with the additional 3 dvd success training course.
I did pass the test on the first try.
Thanks for all your help,
Frank Camodeca


I just want to thank you for providing me with all the necessary study material I need for the state exam. I passed my salesperson exam on my first attempt. I could not have done it with out the help of Lumbleau Real Estate school. I have referred your classes to all of my co-workers.
Thank you again for all your help.
Matt Ehrman


Dear John:
I just wanted to let you know how much I appreciated taking your Real Estate Salesperson California State Exam Passing Course. It was very interesting and educational and your lectures were filled with knowledge.

I wanted to say that I was not sure if I would pass this first time through, as I had missed a few too many questions on two of the mock up final exams. But when I got to the Los Angeles Convention Center and opened my test, I breezed right through it, and out of an incredible amount of 2,000 people, I was one of the first people to finish. It only took me two hours to complete my exam.

The one thing I noticed in the approach taken by you in teaching us this course, is that we actually learned the material rather than just learning answers. For those that come in behind me, they need to know that. Once you learn the material, you will have no problem in passing the state exam, as long as they dedicate themselves to learning and reviewing the information you provide.

One other thing for those people waiting to hear results in California. The state is so far behind at this time, it takes longer to get scheduled as well as receive your results. The usual test sites arranged are usually 100 people, but because of a back log of entrants, there were more than 2000 people in attendance. This was something I did not expect and was quite overwhelming at the time.

Again, I just want to extend a huge "Thank You," and I look forward to scheduling my other classes that I will be taking over the next months and years.
Wishing you and yours Happy Holidays.
Sincerely,
Kip Parrott


John,
Thanks so much for your course. It was exaclty what I needed to pass the state exam. My father was a student of yours almost 30 years ago, he passed then as I passed now. He reccomended you as I do to others who are interested in a career in real estate.
Thanks Again!
John Lockhart


Hi John,
I easily passed the DRE exam.
Thanks!
Alan Bailey


Thanks Lumbleau Schools.
I just received word I passed the state examination for a sales agent. I took the test December the 8th, 2003 and received a confirmation of passing at the DRE's website the 10th of December.
I was VERY happy with the results of a lot of hard work. Lumbleau Schools gave me what I needed, and I can't recommend them anymore highly. After going through 14 study sections and the related tests I was totally prepared for the state examination. I admit I had some "test anxiety" but after answering the first 10 questions I knew it would be a walk in the park. Thanks again Lumbleau Schools. You guys have it down.
Best,
Norm Carter


John,
Thank you so much for your class!
I diligently studied and passed the exam on first try!
Now I have applied for broker’s exam and will begin my studies soon!
Happy holidays and thanks for your help and encouragement along the way!
Paula Gray


Thanks for all of the udpated questions. I just found out last night that I pass the state exam. The DVDs as well as the correspondings questions were fantastic tools in which to study with.
Jon Pollock


Hey John!,
I just wanted to let you know that I took the CA RE Salesperson exam this past 10/06/03, and by 10/08/03 the DRE Webstite read: Contgratulations! You Passed!
What a relief. You have a great product and I will be contacting you regarding the Broker Exam. For those who don't believe in this product I can say I met two people at my testing location planning on taking the exam again! Duh??...Just call Lumbleau!!
Thanks,
D.Thompson.


Dear John,
I would like you to be one of the 1st people to know that I passed the State Test. It a fantastic feeling to know that I did it. But I know, I may not have pass if it was not for your course. I found you web site, and called your school one member of your staff send me a sample of a lesson on a DVD only half way though I paused it and called the school and order the full course. John talked to me for over 15 minutes, with the confidence and motivation you gave me, I worked hard, I had to; I had 20 days before my exam. I have been out of college since 1980. And jumping back in to school is not an easy thing to do. For me, succeeding in passing the state test, is the start of great things to come. My test day was Aug 12, 2003.
Sincerely,
Jerry S.


My wife and I would like to thank you. Your courses made the state exam effortless. We have sold over 4 million in Real Estate our 1st year. Thanks John!
Steve and Gina Gomez


Hi John,
Just wanted to let you know how pleased I was with your Principles course and exam preparation. I was able to watch the tapes and do the questions on my own time which was very important to me since I am a single mother with a full time job.
I am happy to report that I finished the test in about an hour, I was the third one finished out of 200 people. The questions were exactly as I had studied them and I felt very good when leaving. I was not surprised to find out I passed the test a few days later. I now have my real estate license and have already sold my first house.
Thanks for everything!
Sincerely,
Lisa Marie Sidlow


Hi John,
I wanted to thank you for your course. I just found out that I passed the state exam after taking it under special circumstances. To make a long story short, I started studying (intensely) ten days before the exam; reading all of the lessons and doing most of the lesson tests and exams. For those ten days I gave it "90%" effort so "I could get off the ground" and I did! I was thrilled to find out that I passed considering my time limitation. I attribute my success to the material you provided me with...thank you!
Nick Levi


Dear Mr. Lumbleau,
I purchased your Real Estate Sales course in late April of 2003. I can't tell you how happy I am that I found and used your course. The amount of information in your video's, textbook's and computer program is incredible. Your style of teaching is wonderful; I could hardly wait to finish my current lesson just so I could move on to the next lesson.
The amount of motivation you gave me from your videos inspired me and gave me confidence. I took my state exam on June 17, 2003, after taking your course and doing all the things you told me to do. I entered that exam room with great confidence and after one hour and ten minutes left with even more confidence. I was one of two other people who were the first to complete their exam, I suspect they also took the Lumbleau Real Estate Sales course. I just wanted you to know how much impact you have had on my life. You had a hand in turning a 21-year-old high school drop out into a loan officer at a great mortgage company. I have had an interest in Real Estate for some time but was always afraid of the exam. Thanks to you I over came that fear. I cannot thank you enough for your course and I hope that the Lumbleau School of real estate will be around for a long time. You give people a chance to succeed in life.
Sincerely,
Dominic D. Roybal


Dear John,
I just wanted to thank you for preparing me for the state exam for July 9, 2003. I passed the exam the first attempt. Your method of teaching was exactly what I need it. I'm fifty eight years old and haven't been in school for nearly 30 years.
Thanks,
M. Wagner


John,
I wanted to say thanks for your Salesperson class... I passed on the first attempt. I felt when I left (I was the 3rd person to leave) that I had achieved an 85% to 90% score with no problem. So thanks again for your course.
Best Regards,
Kevin Prince


July 16, 2003,
John, I just took the Salesperson's test in LA and passed thanks to your course. I only had time to make it through the videos, but there was plenty of content in them.

Jonathan S


Your course so prepared me for the state exam that I was tempted to ask the proctor if they had a harder, more challenging test!
Thank you!
Shannon Seif


Hello John,
Just wanted to thank you for providing an outstanding course. I passed my test with ease it took me about 1 hour and I was done and feeling very confident about what I was tested on.
Warmest Regards,
Marie Marini


Thank you!!! This course is great!!
And I love your videos, you are a SUPER teacher, so glad I made the extra investment for the videos too...what a great help!! After my license I'm going to definitely go on to your sales course...then the broker in a couple years, after my required experience. I highly recommend this course...I hope you don't mind my questions.
Liana Petritsch


Hi John,
I'm so excited!! I passed the exam - thank you so very much for your wonderful course & your help in getting the download to work for me - I really, really appreciate your help & your wonderful course!

I've got a quick question, through out the video series you mentioned that you teach a sales training class. Is that on video and can I purchase it? I would love to learn from you how to be successful in selling real estate. If you could let me know, I would greatly appreciate it.
Thank you very, very much!!!
Katricia N. Navarrete


Very nice course. Initially I thought there were too many practice questions. I did take the time to go through them all and the salesperson exam was a breeze. I'll be in touch when I do my broker's next year.
Thanks,
T. Junn


Dear John,
Thank you, I resently PASSED the California Real Estate Exam and wanted to tell you that it was your course, and your one on one coaching via the video tapes, that made it possible. I am looking forward to your salespersons training course, if it does for me what the exam prep course did then I KNOW that I will be extremely sucessful.
Eternal thanks,
Louis Godman


I passed the test with no problems. As you know, they don't give scores, but I feel certain that I missed no more than 15 questions.

Thanks for your program and your timely and professional responses.
Best regards,
Don Reedy


Awesome ! Thanks again ! And a tip of the hat to you and your staff - No one I've dealt with on the net has been as efficient as you have in answering questions immedately ! Kudos ! !
Tony Hoffman ~ BCST


After watching the first 30 minutes of Tape 1, you got me pumped up. Actually, more pumped than Napolean Hill did with his Think and Grow Rich. My little brother gave me that book in college and I've read it 3 times already and it's my favorite. But you actually made me feel like I will succeed without the auto-suggestions Dr. Hill recommends. You're great!!!

I want to let know how much I am enjoying the course. It is very complete and I like the way each tape and each computer lesson go together.
Thank you,
Danielle Deal-Means, Woodland CA


This course has been great. To the point, practical, and very understandable.
Stanley Wainie


John, what a wonderful job you have done with your video lesson tapes! Thanks!!
Gayle Bybee


Hi John,
I just wanted to thank you for the course that you created. Because I managed to pass the state exam. The wisdom that you gave in the beginning of each video lesson was something I needed to hear. You inspired me and totally taught me what I have to do to change myself for better. It is unexplainable almost to tell you how much your words meant to me. Without that wisdom there was no way I would have passed my exam.
Thank you.
Sincerely,
Yumiko Moses


John, I wanted to let you know how happy I was when I heard the results automated message on real estate board phone "Congratulations, you have passed the state exam". The entire credit goes to you. I studied the courses that you provided and watched the video tapes. The video tapes were so convenient that I saved so much of time that I would have spent travelling to the classes held here in SFO. In spite of working full time, I made it a point to study at least an hour everyday and practised all the sample exam questions that you provided. And there is no way one can fail after undergoing such a comprehensive objective questions exercises. I thank you a lot for your help. I understand that passing the real estate exam is the easiest step in the real estate career. The real test starts now. But with your continued support and encouragement I am sure I can sail through the challenges of this career successfully.
Regards,
Anna Reddy


Mr Lumbleau!
Thank you! Early on in the course you said: "a salesperson sells, a student studies." So, I studied! Ken became "a dull boy" - for a couple of months. And I have to tell you your training works. I took the actual State Exam yesterday in San Diego, and that exam was a piece of cake. I would be astonished if I missed more than 3 questions out of the 150 questions total.
There were lots of people there who were taking the test for the 3rd time; so, as the test proceeded I was quite anxious, and kept expecting the questions to get tough - but it never happened. The last 50 questions were as easy as the first 50.
Ken Stevens


I passed the CA salesman test on the first try! It was a breeze... finished in 80min... Identical questions to the study materials...
Michael Valente


John:
Thanks very much for a great course study and I will be calling you for my Broker's license mterials. I passed all my courses with ease!
Again, many thanks!
Michael Landolfi


Mr. Lumbleau,
I just wanted to thank you for such a great learning experience! With two young children to take care of, real estate school was out of the question, When the kids were sleeping, I popped in your tapes. You are so good in the tapes, you forget your watching TV. Im 31 years old and have been a waitress for 15 years.... and just found out today, Ive passed my state exam!! I just had to write you to thank you for your course, it was so clear and in only 1/4 the time as school. I was at ease during the exam, because I knew all the answers! I will be coming back to you for other courses that need to be taken.
Jennifer Alcantar


Dear Mr. Lumbleau,
I just wanted to take a moment to thank you for your easy to follow passing course. I passed on my first try just as promised (or my money back)!
You also stated in one of your video courses that Lumbleau students usually complete their exam within approximately 1 hour and 1/2. I wouldn't have believed it my self if it hadn't happed to me. I was the second person done with my exam, out of approximately 35 examinees, and took only 1 hour 24 and minutes!
I will recommend your course to anyone.
Sincerely,
Ruth G., El Dorado CA


Dear John, I can not express enough the help I received from your video course. Before ordering with you I had spent 6 months trying to study the real estate manual I had received threw the Company I was going to work with. Unable to understand any of the information I was reading. I was so frustrated and ready to give up. I was referred to you by a friend who highly recommended your course. 

Needless to say it was unbelievable, after a few minutes into the first tape I could understand the terminology. You explained every paragraph in layman Terms. The math video was also exceptional. My father is a math teacher and was so impressed he was going to use some of the formulas in his class. 

I am so blessed to of found your program. I just passed the state Board, and owe you great thanks!!!!. I am referring your program to everyone I know getting into Real Estate.

Thanks again. Sincerely,
Cindy D., Milpitas CA


John, I purchased your series of videos in February, and I followed your instructions to the letter. I worked full time and went through your training in the evenings. Each tape was fantastic and tremendously informative. I very much enjoyed your style of teaching, and as a person that has also read "Think and Grow Rich" a number of times, I was very excited about your introductions on each video. I studied something about Real Estate every day, and took your advice as to which of your additional courses to take, and I passed the State Exam first time. 

Your course was so thorough, and the positive re-enforcing messages from you were so effective, that I went into the Exam as well prepared as anyone that has ever taken it. As you predicted about your serious students, I breezed through the exam, finishing in 2.5 hours, and that was in Downtown Los Angeles with a very noisy Laker Parade right outside the window. When I left the exam, I called the Broker that had agreed to let me work for him (if I pass the State Exam), and I told him that I had passed with a minimum score of 90% (which is exactly how I felt). 

Thank You very much John. I am now running Open Houses every Saturday and Sunday and picking up really nice clients every time. I am so excited about my Real Estate career, and I would like to let you know that it was the foundation I got from you that made all the difference.

Sincerely
Steve M., Northridge CA


Mr. Lumbleau,
After listening to you talk about Napoleon Hill’s "Think and Grow Rich", on how you thought of him as your mentor, I decided to purchase the book and see what you thought so highly of Mr. Hill. I have read the first five chapters in the first sitting and I must admit that I am captivated on what he is talking about. I have found a statement that Mr. Hill stated, and that I now have printed up and have in front of my computer which I highly believe in, is:

If the things you wish to do is right, and you believe in it, go ahead and do it! Put your dream across, and never mind what "they" say if you meet with temporary defeat, for "they," perhaps, do not know that every failure brings with it the seed of an equivalent success.

My Father always told me, never let someone else dampen the dreams you have. I have always been told also to surround yourself with people who know what they are talking about. That is why I went with the Lumbleau School of Real Estate. You have been in this game for a long time. Thank you for what I have learned so far.
Sincerely,
Don Luther
