					<h4>"YOUHAVE A GENUINE DESIRE TO SEE THAT EVERY PERSON PASSES"</h4>
					<p>Hello Mr. Lumbleau, I wanted to thank you for dedicating your life to sharing your knowledge and enthusiasm for the benifit of so many people. After purchasing your course I had a few questions on getting started and called your office on three different occasions and you personaly answered the phone. I was quite surprised and was caught off guard but knew I had just purchased the right course. You have a genuine desire to not only to see to it that every student passes the state exam, but to coach us all on the secrets of success. I enjoyed the tutorials before each lesson and the stories that went along with your invaluable advice on how to succeed. It`s hard enough for some to study, so keeping it interesting is a bonus. Thank-you for the free success videos. There are many success videos out there but few that relate to the field of real estate that as are comprehensive as your`s. I took the state exam and passed it the first time. I look forward to further my education through your systems. Thanks again.</p>

					<h4>"YOU'RE AWESOME"</h4>
					<p>John, Just thought I’d give you a shout-out and say “Thank you” for helping me pass the DRE Exam on the 1st attempt. This was actually the 2nd time I had to take the exam due to the fact I let my license lapse 15yrs ago. I took Lumbleau Real Estate School then and passed the 1st try also. I currently have friends trying to pass the DRE test and have failed. I told each of them that I was scheduled to take the exam and I was going through Lumbleau. They didn’t know what I was talking about so I showed them your web-site and how you administer your courses. Then, when it was my turn to go into L.A. and take the test, everyone was curious how I’d do. 4 days after taking the exam, I showed them the DRE page and showed them I passed!! Greatest testimonial you could ever publish. I think a few called you right after they saw my results. Thanks again John!! You’re awesome!!</p>

					<h4>"YOU ARE AN INCREDIBLE TEACHER"</h4>
					<p>Dear Mr Lumbleau, I just took the Broker exam in Oakland, CA and PASSED the first time! I thought your course was very good at an unbelievable price! Many of the identical questions on your practice exams were on the test. Most importantly, I learned so much from your online lectures. You are an incredible teacher, explaining difficult concepts in a very interesting way. Thank you very much!</p>

					<h4>"I PASSED THE BROKER EXAM"</h4>
					<p>Lumbleau Real Estate Schools is the oldest Real Estate School in California and today I send a great big THANK YOU to John Lumbleau! The reason for my thank you is today I received notice that I passed the California Department of Real Estate BROKER's EXAM! And I am thanking John, for preparing me to take and pass the exam. The Lumbleau Real Estate Schools. The prep program was both thorough and demanding. But, as I was seated and waiting for the exam...a sense of calm came over me. As the exam progressed, I could hear the distinctive voice of John Lumbleau. You see...John knows more about the Department of Real Estate exams than just about anybody in California. There were no surprises on the exam and I felt well prepared...nervous, but well prepared! Thank You...JOHN LUMBLEAU! You're the man...</p>

					<h4>"THE FIRST REPORT ON THE NEW SCRAMBLED QUESTION COMPUTER EXAMS"</h4>
					<p>Hi Mr. Lumbleau, Thanks for all the guided help for the preparation of the California Broker's Exam. Taking the exam in the new computerized testing center, the results were given immediately after the completion of the test, which I passed on 09/09/2009! Your advice on working through the chapters one by one cannot be overemphasized to get the successful result of passing the broker's exam. The organization of your prep course was very helpful and the questions to focus on were very exact. All I had to do was to consistently work through each chapter and gauge the weeks leading up to the actual exam date. The basic structure of your course offered the main concepts by repetition. That is why I could remember a great percentage of the material. Your material was relevant in content for a good prep. Since I had worked through your guided material, I was able to capture and remember a great part of the question/answer sets throughout the real exam. Thank you once again. Now, I am ready to start my own LLC as a realty business. I'm listening to the "Success Video" included in your Web site.</p>
