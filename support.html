			        <h4 class="supportBlockQuestions">How do I get a California real estate license?</h4>
			        <p class="supportBlockContent">To receive your California real estate license you must complete 3 approved college equivalent real estate courses and pass a state test. Our program is designed for students to complete the three courses while studying our exam passing course and be prepared to pass the state exam within 11 weeks. As described by the chart below, each real estate course (RE Principles, RE Practice & 3rd Course) requires 18 days to complete. Upon completing three courses you can apply to the CalBRE for your state exam. Study the 14 lessons in our exam passing course during this 11 week process. Our exam passing course includes text, 14 two hour videos and interactive quizzes. These 14 lessons, over 2700 sample test questions and 5 sample state tests will prepare you to pass the college equivalent real estate courses and the state exam.</p>

			        <p class="supportBlockContent">In most cases it is because you have entered an incorrect login or your 1 year enrollment period has expired. You may confirm your login information or reenroll at a discount by calling our support at 877-635-9944.</p>

			        <h4 class="supportBlockQuestions">Is home study better than live classroom instruction?</h4>
			        <p class="supportBlockContent">John Lumbleau taught real estate classes and had numerous classroom locations in California for decades before the personal computer. Mr. Lumbleau found that while offering live instruction many students could not make all of the classes, wasted a lot of time discussing non-relevant material, and had difficulty keeping students interested during long lectures. Home study courses allow students to receive the same high quality education they would receive in a traditional live class but in a more convenient format. Online courses can be completed 24 hours a day, seven days a week, when it is convenient for you. The classroom is as close as your internet connected computer and there is no commute.</p>

			    <li class="supportBlock">
			        <h4 class="supportBlockQuestions">Why should I choose Lumbleau Real Estate School?</h4>
			        <p class="supportBlockContent">Unlike national real estate schools, Lumbleau specializes in only California real estate students. Since 1948 and over 600,000 students, the secret of our success is that we have the only program organized by subject, totally explained. We have the largest database of questions, currently over 3,000, and invested over $250,000 in an interactive internet software method of first testing and then explaining every question one at a time. Our software program allows you to set aside every question you can answer easily answer and “tag” only difficult questions building a personal study base for further review. 

					While taking the three mandatory courses over the required 7 ½ weeks you take 14 motivational video exam-passing classroom sessions – each followed by an average of 200 debriefed questions. Then you take 5 equivalent state exams while waiting for your state date. You take 2 video lectures per week for the first 6 weeks and then one per week during weeks 7 and 8. The final 2 to 3 weeks are filled with 5 state test equivalent 150 question tests plus an additional database of our most recently added questions which is equivalent to a weekend “crash” course.

With our system of home study, students must wait 18 days between courses but time tracking is not required. If you are also enrolled in our extensive exam passing course you will find that our exam passing material of 14 lessons, 33 hours of streaming video, and over 2700 sample test questions will prepare you to pass most real estate college equivalent courses and the state test.

			        <h4 class="supportBlockQuestions">Why is Lumbleau  Real Estate School exam passing the best ?</h4>
			        <p class="supportBlockContent">Lumbleau has become the broker exam passing specialist. We performed a market test in May 2003 by exclusively mailing to only broker applicants and concentrating on teaching to only brokers on how to pass the state exam. The result of our broker training increased the total broker pass rate to equal or exceed the agent pass rate. Having a broker pass rate exceed the agent pass rate had never before happened in the 70 year history of the Department of Real Estate (now Bureau of Real Estate). How did this happen? The Lumbleau method takes seven weeks to train a student to understand the material, be motivated, and sales trained for a successful career. We refuse to lower our educational standards to a three week course or a weekend “crash” course. Our future brokers receive over 3,000 totally explained textbook-referenced state equivalent questions, four practice state exams with 200 questions each and over 350 updated questions. This insures that you will pass the state broker exam the first time. We guarantee it!</p>
